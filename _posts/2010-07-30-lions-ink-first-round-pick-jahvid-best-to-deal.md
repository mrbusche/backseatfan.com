  <p>
    The Detroit Lions have signed first round pick Jahvid Best to a <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/07/30/lions-get-one-of-their-first-rounders-under-contract/">5 year, $9.8 million deal</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The guaranteed money has not yet come out for Best's deal but the overall deal appears to be considerably smaller than the $12.25 million deal Kenny Britt signed last year as the 30th overall pick.
  </p>

  <p>
    Best was the Lions 2nd pick of the first round, they acquired the pick after trading with their division rival Minnesota Vikings. The signing <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2010/05/2010-nfl-draft-rookie-signing-status-team-by-team/">leaves the Lions</a> with just Ndamukong Suh to sign.
  </p>

  <p>
    Best was an explosive player throughout his college career but he suffered two concussions last year. One was considered minor ('minor') and the other was a <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2009/11/jahvid-best-suffers-severe-neck-injuryin-california-vs-oregon-state-game-video/">devastating fall</a> in which it appeared Best was paralyzed.
