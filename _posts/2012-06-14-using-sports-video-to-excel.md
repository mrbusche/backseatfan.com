The media and tools are there, in almost everybody's hands - why not &nbsp;bnuw\ use them?

    And, for parents - such as a father with a mean poker game - a tablet provides great options to take a few moments of fun for themselves when the kids are occupied. That benefit shouldn't be underestimated!
