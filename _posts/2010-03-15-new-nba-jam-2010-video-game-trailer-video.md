    Here is a preview of EA Sports NBA Jam 2010,which should be coming out later this year for the Wii. It looks like it plays just like the original, but with upgraded graphics. I am going to buy this one for sure. It Looks awesome, and I can't wait. BOOM SHAKALAKA!!!

    NBA Jam 2010 even has all the classic sound effects, did they even need to hire a new guy? Because they sound exactly the same to me. I really like the 2d/3d graphics that are coming out on the Wii, it brings me back to my childhood playing Super Nintendo all day long.
