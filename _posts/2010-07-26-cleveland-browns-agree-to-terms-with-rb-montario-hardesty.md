  <p>
    According to <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2010/07/cleveland_browns_agree_to_term_1.html">Mary Kay Cabot</a> from the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the Browns have agree to terms on a deal with 2nd round RB Montario Hardesty. Terms were undisclosed but it is likely the deal is for 4 years and around $3 million with somewhere between $1.5 and $1.6M guaranteed according to <a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2010/04/2010-nfl-draft-rookie-signing-status/">other players signed</a> around Hardesty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hardesty was the leading rusher for the Tennessee Volunteers last season amassing 1345 yards on 282 carries, scoring 13 TDs. He also had 25 catches for 302 yards. Hardesty should push incumbent Jerome Harrison in training camp for the starting role. If he doesn't become the starter, still expect at least 150 carries this season for Hardesty.

    Check out a few of Hardesty's highlights from this past season against South Carolina. The spin move at :35 is sick.<br />
