    The Seattle Seahawks have signed their first round pick Russell Okung.
  </p>

  <p>
    Okung signed a 6 year, $58 Million dollar contract with $30 million guaranteed with the Seahawks. Okung received a much larger contract than last year's 6th pick round pick Andre Smith. But Okung also has 2 more years on his deal.

  <p>
    The sixth round pick out of Oklahoma State was the final pick signed out of the first round.Â  This leaves only injured Sergio Kindle unsigned.
