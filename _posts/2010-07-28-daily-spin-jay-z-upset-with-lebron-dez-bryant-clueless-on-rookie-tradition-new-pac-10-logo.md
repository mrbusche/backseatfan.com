    <em>So ESPN pulled this LeBron James story, No idea why the pulled it, it didn't seem to offensive, but my guess was James didn't like it.  Who controls ESPN?  The writers, the talking heads, or LeBron James and company? Thanks For Reading Folks, People seem to love the Daily Spin.</em>

    <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2010/07/strasburg-diagnosis-shoulder-inflamation/1">Stephen Strasburg has shoulder inflammation</a>, according to an MRI and X-rays but nothing serious? Miguel Batista pitched instead, it was his first start in 2 years, and he pitched a winning game for the Nationals?  I don't like Batista's quote though, he is anti Iowa.

    I think it's more like imagine if you went to a game where you expected a to see Miss Universe, but instead you saw Miss "65 year old grandma" that thinks shes young and pretty but is really old, wrinkly, and saggy; and should probably realize it is about time to retire?<br /> [via <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2010/07/strasburg-diagnosis-shoulder-inflamation/1">USA Today</a>]
