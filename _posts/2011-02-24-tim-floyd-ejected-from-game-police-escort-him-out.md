  <p>
    Tim Floyd was ejected from the UTEP at East Carolina game and escorted out by Police. The refs called four technical fouls on UTEP coaching staff in a five-minute span, that has to be a record. Plus they called one more technical foul later in the game. UTEP coach Phil Johnson was also ejected. The ejections forced UTEP undergraduate assistant Greg Foster to take over as head coach for the game. East Carolina won the game over UTEP 83-76. I guess they can blame it on the coaching.
