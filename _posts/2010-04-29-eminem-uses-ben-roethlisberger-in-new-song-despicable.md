    Eminem references Ben Roethlisberger in his new song &#8220;Despicable&#8221;. At about the 35 second mark the lyrics say: &#8220;I'd rather turn this club into a bar room brawl. Get as rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall.&#8221;

    It’s always good when an athlete is referenced in a song, right? Joltin’ Joe DiMaggio always had a nice ring to it. Rapin’ Ben Roethlisberger? It's close, but just not the same.
