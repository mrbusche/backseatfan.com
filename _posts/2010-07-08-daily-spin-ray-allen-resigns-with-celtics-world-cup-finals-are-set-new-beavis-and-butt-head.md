    <em>Another great edition of the Daily Spin, I lost track since I have done so many? The Hawkeyes are set for an undefeated season, LeBron James is getting sued for a paternity suit cover up, Purple Drank testing, and I AM CORNHOLIO, I NEED TEPEE FOR MY BUNGHOLE. </em>

Oh and the Heat or Magic are going to make the Finals instead anyway.  [<a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=AmxnFq_lz3eH_pDBueoF6JQ5nYcB?slug=ap-celtics-allen">Yahoo Sports</a>]

    Mike Freeman of CBS <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/columns/story/13610695?tag=pageRow;pageContainer">tries the Purple Drank</a>, for journalistic purposes? So the Purple Drank makes you feel woozy like when you are on cough syrup, weird, because that's what it is.  I think the real high is when you mix hard alcohol with it.  But doesn't that work with every prescription drug that says do not take with alcohol?  [via <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/columns/story/13610695?tag=pageRow;pageContainer">CBS Sports</a>]
