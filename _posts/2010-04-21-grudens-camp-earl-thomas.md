  <p>
    If you haven't seen this series with Jon Gruden yet, I'm sorry, this could be a hit show if ESPN had an hour of these interviews each week. In this series <a href="http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=5121703">Gruden critiques Earl Thomas</a>. Thomas seems like a really down to earth guy and Gruden didn't have a ton of negative things to say about him. Thomas looked a little intimidated when Gruden shows the video of some of his weightlifting sessions but other than that I love this guy. I hope the Vikings take him if he's still on the board at 30.<a href="/images/2010/04/earl-thomas.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5420" title="earl-thomas" src="/images/2010/04/earl-thomas-300x168.jpg" alt="earl-thomas" width="300" height="168" srcset="/images/2010/04/earl-thomas-300x168.jpg 300w, /images/2010/04/earl-thomas.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
