  <h2>
    First Round
  </h2>

  <h3>
    Eastern Conference
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>1 Cleveland vs 8 Detroit</strong> - Cleveland should sweep, not much to really talk about here. <strong>Cavs in 4.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>2 Boston vs 7 Chicago</strong> - Chicago won't be able to score enough and even without Garnett the Celtics are a better team. <strong>Celtics in 6.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>3 Orlando Magic vs 6 Philadelphia 76ers</strong> - Orlando is a top 5 defensive team and the 76ers are atrocious at shooting 3s. That makes it impossible to win in the playoffs.<strong> Magic in 5.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>4 Atlanta Hawks vs 5 Miami Heat</strong> - DeWayne Wade can win games by himself but Atlanta has a lot more talent in their starting lineup. Miami is too one dimensional to win a playoff series this year. The Heat need one more year of development from Beasley and Chalmers. <strong>Hawks in 6.</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>
    Western Conference
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>1 Los Angeles Lakers vs 8 Utah Jazz</strong> - Utah has won 12 out of 13 vs the Lakers at home and could make this more of a series than people think they will.<strong> Lakers in 6.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>2 Denver Nuggets vs 7 New Orleans Hornets</strong> - Denver has been really good at home this year and JR Smith has been on fire but Chris Paul is an animal and he'll push this to seven games.<strong> Nuggets in 7.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>3 San Antonio Spurs vs 6 Dallas</strong> - Dallas is playing really well right now. Jason Terry is playing really well and Dirk Nowitzski is not getting any love this year. <strong>Dallas in 7.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>4 Portland Trail Blazers vs 5 Houston Rockets</strong> - Portland is the hottest team in the West right now but they have to go through the Lakers just to get to the Western Conference Finals. This will be a good series. <strong>Trail Blazers in 7.</strong>
