    Don't really think this looks good for you Tiger.

  <p>
    Would you drop him if you were his sponsor?
  </p>

  <p>
    I wouldn't he is still going to be a huge icon, and make you tons of money. But this would be a good time to maybe lower his price tag.

    <strong>Tiger Wood's official statement:</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    "I have let my family down and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart. I have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves," he said in a statement on his official Web site.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I am not without faults and I am far short of perfect. I am dealing with my behavior and personal failings behind closed doors with my family. Those feelings should be shared by us alone."
