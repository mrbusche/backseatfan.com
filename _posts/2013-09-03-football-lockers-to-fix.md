  <p>
    Football is a national sport in many Countries of the world, where it&rsquo;s played at different levels from young kids up to the most popular and beloved players.
  </p>

  <p>
    Generally, people get attracted to a particular <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Become-a-College-Football-Player">sport</a> for cultural reasons. In fact, the more popular that sport is in their family or society, the more they have chances to develop a certain interest for it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most sport bettors have personally played a sport at least once or twice in their life and most of them tend to bet in those sports they know better because they have played them.

  <h2>
    Practicing football since childhood
  </h2>

  <p>
    In those Countries of the world where football is the most popular sport, children are naturally addressed by their parents towards the practice of this sport. There are specific football courses for children who are under 5 and so on up to the adult age.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each town may have several teams divided on the basis of the age of their players. Most towns have also a stadium to play matches and another field for training.
  </p>

  <p>
    Normally, this field is provided with a series of lockers where all players can keep their clothes and other supplies they need. Each locker can be locked using a key which is given by the football association.

    What to do in case of trouble
  </h2>

    However, even if each locker is well locked, it might always be possible that something goes wrong. This happens when the key is damaged or when the lock is very old. In this case, the mechanism of the lock (even if it&rsquo;s normally very simple) can stop to work the right way.
