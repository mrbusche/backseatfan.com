    Marshay Green, CB, Mississippi<br /> Max Hall, QB, BYU<br /> A.J. Jefferson, CB, Fresno State<br /> Casey Knips, OT, South Dakota State<br /> Max Komar, WR, Idaho<br /> David Moosman, C/G, Michigan<br /> Alphonso Smith, RB, Kentucky<br /> Juamorris Stewart, WR, Southern<br /> Devin Tyler, OT, Temple<br /> Stephen Williams, WR, Toledo
