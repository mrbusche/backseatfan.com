    The USC football program has been given a two-year postseason ban, a reduction in schoalrships and will forfeit wins from the 2004 season when the NCAA announces actions today. The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-usc-20100610,0,7548894.story">LA Times</a> reported that USC will lose more than 20 scholarships.

    The sad thing is players who are currently students will suffer for the actions of previous players AND the previous coaching staff. Pete Carroll sure got out in time to avoid consequences, didn't he? Reggie Bush was also able to leverage his situation to make big time NFL money and now the little guys will take the brunt of the punishment.

    A 2 year ban should weaken USC just enough so that when <a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2010/06/big-12-to-be-dissolved-6-teams-leaving-for-pac-10/">Texas and Oklahoma join the Pac 10/16</a> they will be the favorites to win the conference each year.
