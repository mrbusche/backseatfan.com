    This is a pretty interesting infographic from <a href="http://www.mint.com/blog/trends/the-tiger-woods-economy/?display=wide">Mint.com</a>.  Turns out Tiger woods is pretty damn important to the Golfing Economy.  $30 million dollars a city for the Buick Open alone.  I went to the Phoenix Open this year, and it was busy, but I am sure if Tiger was there it would go crazy.

    Let's face it, I don't care about professional golf as much when Tiger isn't playing, and that goes for the rest of you reading this.  Tiger makes a huge impact, until someone can take his spot it will stay that way.  Chances are Tiger will be even more watched now than ever before.
