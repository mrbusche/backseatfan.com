    The San Diego Chargers agreed to<a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcwest/post/_/id/15707/seahawks-betting-big-on-whitehurst"> trade QB Charlie Whitehurst </a>to the Seattle Seahawks for a 3rd round pick in 2011 and a swap of picks in 2010. In the exchange of 2nd round picks the Chargers receive the 40th overall choice while the Seahawks receive the 60th overall choice.

    If Whitehurt turns into a good starter for the Seahawks this could turn into a steal for the Seahawks who are expected to pay Whitehurt about $5 million annually. If not this could turn out to be one of the worst signings in history considering $5 million a year for a veteran who has never started a game in unprecedented in the NFL. Apparently the Â Seahawks must have seen something they liked in his very limited playing time in 2006.
