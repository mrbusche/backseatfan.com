    Halloween is scary, at least if you are a Hawkeye fan. The Hawkeyes are now 9-0 after their win today over Indiana. They had a crappy first half, and a crappy 3rd quarter. Things made a turn around after Tyler Sashes crazy interception. The hawks finished off with a great 4th quarter and won the game by double digits.
