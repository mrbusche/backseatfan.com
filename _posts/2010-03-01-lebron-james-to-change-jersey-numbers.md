  <p>
    LeBron James will more than likely have a new number next year. He wanted to switch jerseys to honor Michael Jordan (and make money I'm sure).
  </p>

  <p>
    James filed paperwork to switch from No. 23 to No. 6, according to the <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2010/03/lebron_james_files_application.html">Cleveland Plain Dealer</a>. The deadline for the jersey switch is Wednesday. So LeBron should have a new number next year as long is the league approves it.
  </p>

  <p>
    LeBron chose #6 because that is the number he had during the Olympics.  So wherever James goes next season, they better have the #6 jersey open.
