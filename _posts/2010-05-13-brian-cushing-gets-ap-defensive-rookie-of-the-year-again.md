  <p>
    Brian Cushing got to keep his AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award that he was stripped of by the Associated Press. I thought it was a smart move by yanking the award, but then to vote him back?  Stupid idea.  I don't care if you think he was the best, he cheated and he shouldn't have even gotten the opportunity to be revoted in.  The AP just made themselves look like fools.  Congrats Brian, you are still a cheater.
