    Cleveland travels to the NBA All-Star game, and guess who is there a bunch of NBA players. The episode features Steve Nash, Shaq, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard, Kevin Garnett, and Dirk Nowitzki.

    The Best part of the whole show, "See, LeBron really doesn't hate Cleveland"
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall it was a pretty funny episode, I would recommend it to anyone who wants a quick laugh.
  </p>

  <p>
    Plus the NBA players fight little people.

    Here is a quick interview with Dirk Nowitzki and a behind the scenes look at the Cleveland Show:
