      Not much change at the top this week, but we do have a shakeup in the bottom 10.
    </p>

    <p>
      1. New York Jets (5-1) - I don't think a bye week can drop them from their pedestal, although the Steelers are coming on strong.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. Pittsburgh Steelers (5-1) - The Steelers got a nice win against a Miami team that struggles at home. Big Ben isn't quite in midseason form yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. Baltimore Ravens (5-2) - The bye week should help Flacco and Rice get back in the swing of things.
    </p>

    <p>
      4. New York Giants (5-2) - Can anyone name the league's leading rusher? Yep, it's Ahmad Bradshaw.
    </p>

    <p>
      5. New England Patriots (5-1) - The Patriots are on a mission to show they didn't/don't need Randy Moss. So far so good.
    </p>

    <p>
      6. Indianapolis colts (4-2) - Peyton has shown he can survive with just about any WR, but how about with Brody Eldridge at TE?
    </p>

    <p>
      7. Atlanta Falcons (5-2) - They stepped off the gas a little early last week, but Roddy White showed he's still one of the best WR's in the league.
    </p>

    <p>
      8. Kansas City Chiefs (4-2) - If Dwyane Bowe had been able to catch against the Colts, they'd be 5-1.
    </p>

    <p>
      9. Philadelphia Eagles (4-3) - A bye week is exactly what this team needs. With Vick healthy in week 9 the Eagles should be back.
    </p>

    <p>
      10. Houston Texans (4-2) - Can they beat the Colts twice this season? We'll find out Monday night in a high scoring game.
    </p>

    <p>
      11. Washington Redskins (4-3) - Most of their wins haven't been pretty, but that defense is highly underrated.
    </p>

    <p>
      12. Miami Dolphins (3-3) - For some reason this team plays much better on the road (3-0) then at home (0-3).
    </p>

    <p>
      13. Green Bay Packers (4-3) - Huge win against the Vikings last week with another Greg Jennings sighting.
    </p>

    <p>
      14. Tennessee Titans (5-2) - I know they're 5-2, but I still can't buy into this team.
    </p>

    <p>
      15. New Orleans Saints (4-3) - I know Drew Brees had a kid last week, but how can you explain the rest of his struggles?
    </p>

    <p>
      16. Minnesota Vikings (2-4) - It's do or die against the Patriots this week. Will we see Favre or Tarvaris Jackson?
    </p>

    <p>
      17. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (4-2) - Another team I have trouble buying into, but Josh Freeman surprisingly isn't turning the ball over.
    </p>

    <p>
      18. St. Louis Rams (3-4) - Heartbreaking loss against the Bucs last week, but this team has been in every game this year.
    </p>

    <p>
      19. Cincinnati Bengals (2-4) - Playing from behind Carson Palmer looks like the best QB in the league.
    </p>

    <p>
      20. San Diego Chargers (2-5) - Could the Chargers really finish last in the AFC West?
    </p>

    <p>
      21. Chicago Bears (4-2) - They could sign 5 guys off the street and have a better offensive line.
    </p>

    <p>
      22. Seattle Seahawks (4-2) - Completely different team home vs away. The schedule gets tougher starting this week.
    </p>

    <p>
      23. Arizona Cardinals (3-3) - Their QB situation is brutal. The 49ers are the only team with a worse situation.
    </p>

    <p>
      24. Oakland Raiders (3-4) - There's the Darren McFadden the Raiders thought they drafted.
    </p>

    <p>
      25. Denver Broncos (2-5) - Kyle Orton isn't the problem in Denver, yet they still might bench him for Tebow?
    </p>

    <p>
      26. Cleveland Browns (2-5) - their offense is horrific, but they still find a way to stay in games.
    </p>

    <p>
      27. Dallas Cowboys (1-5) - Maybe the most talented team in the league, certainly not playing like it though.
    </p>

    <p>
      28. Carolina Panthers (1-5) - Matt Moore finally played like the QB we all saw last year.
    </p>

    <p>
      29. Detroit Lions (1-5) - They get Matthew Stafford back this week.
    </p>

    <p>
      30. Jacksonville Jaguars (3-4) - How did they get 3 wins again?
    </p>

    <p>
      31. Buffalo Bills (0-6) - This team isn't very good, but at least they try hard every week.
    </p>

    <p>
      32. San Francisco 49ers (1-6) - All you 49er fans who wanted David Carr. You got what you asked for. There's a reason he wasn't starting ahead of Alex Smith
