    In a game marred by poor officiating, Landon Donovan and Michael Bradley each scored in a furious second-half comeback by the US team. This draw kept the American's chances of advancing to the next round of the World Cup alive.

    Maurice Edu, a second-half subsitution, appeared to put the U.S. ahead in the 86th, poking in close-range shot after Jozy Altidore headed Donovan's free kick to him. But the goal was disallowed by referee Koman Couilibaly of Mali, apparently for a foul before Edu got the ball. Replays show the only fouls on the play were committed by Slovenian players, two of which looked like they deserved penalty kicks.

    "I'm a little gutted to be honest," Donovan said. "I don't know how they stole that last goal from us. I'm not sure what the call was. He (the referee) wouldn't tell us what the call was."
