    A source close to the University of Kentucky athletic program told Fox 35 Sports that Billy Donovan will resign as <a href="https://www.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">Florida Gators'</a> head basketball coach to take the same position at Kentucky.

  <p>
    The University of Kentucky has called a 4:30 p.m. press conference in which the school is expected to announce the firing of head basketball coach Billy Gillispie. Kentucky has reportedly waited until a replacement coach is in place before letting go of Gillispie, who spent two seasons in Lexington.

  <p>
    Donovan led the Gators to back-to-back NCAA men's basketball championships in 2006 and 2007. After the '07 championship, Donovan agreed to become the head coach of the Orlando Magic, but changed his mind a few days later and returned to Gainesville.

    The Gators have not made the NCAA tournament in either of the past two seasons.
