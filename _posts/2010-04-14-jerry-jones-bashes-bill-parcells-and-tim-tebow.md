    Jerry Jones Bashes Bill Parcells and Tim Tebow at a bar. It sounds like Jerry might be a little intoxicated, but hey at least he didn't assault some girl in a bathroom. Chances of him entering some sort of rehab because of the incident? None. He's fucking Jerry Jones. He will probably get a big fine from Roger Goodell, and a firm slap on the wrist, but nothing else will happen. Jerry Jones can't use a third rounder on Tebow because he traded it away to the Lions of terrible Roy Williams.
