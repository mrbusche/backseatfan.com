    Great job by Ludacris poking fun at Tiger Woods in his new song "sexting". He pretty much copied the<a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2009/12/tiger-woods-voice-mail/"> infamous Tiger Woods Voicemail to Jaimee Grubbs</a>. Did he have to pay for the rights?

    The entire song is just making fun of Tiger Woods, so I don't think they are friends. And if they were, they aren't anymore.

    Any one else thinking this has Grammy potential?

    This song will be featured on Ludacris' latest album"Battle Of The Sexes", which is set to be released on March 9, 2010.
