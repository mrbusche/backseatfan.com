    Great job by Ludacris poking fun at Tiger Woods in his new song &#8220;sexting&#8221;. He pretty much copied the<a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2009/12/tiger-woods-voice-mail/"> infamous Tiger Woods Voicemail to Jaimee Grubbs</a>. Did he have to pay for the rights?

    The entire song is just making fun of Tiger Woods, so I don't think they are friends. And if they were, they aren't anymore.

    Any one else thinking this has Grammy potential?

  <p>
    This song will be featured on Ludacris' latest album&#8221;Battle Of The Sexes&#8221;, which is set to be released on March 9, 2010.
