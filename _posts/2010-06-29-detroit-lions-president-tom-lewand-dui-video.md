    Detroit Lion's President <a href="https://www.freep.com/article/20100629/SPORTS01/6290344/1049/SPORTS01/Inside-Tom-Lewands-arrest">Tom Lewand got a DUI</a> this week?  He blew a 2.1, but played it off  decently until the cops started getting pissed at him? Oh yeah and he smelled of alcohol.  Here is the video:

    Maybe he would have gotten out of it if he was in Detroit.  But there are some pretty pissed Lions fans out there.  So it's hard to tell.  Either way, you are the president of a NFL team.  Is it really that expensive to get a cab?  No it's not.
