    <a href="http://twitter.com/sj39">Steven Jackson</a> tweeted earlier this evening about a question that keeps popping up by his followers, Should I draft you in my fantasy football league? Here is Jackson's response.

  <p>
    <em>"I keep getting this ? About FF should I draft u? Well if u don't u will be sorry, it's on u."</em>
  </p>

    then a few minutes later, this
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>"Thx 4 the support I PROMISE I will RUN like the only way I know how. That's BEAST MODE!!"</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    It's nice to see players engaging their fans and having some fun in the process.
  </p>

    Good luck this season SJ, we at backseatfan will be rooting for you
