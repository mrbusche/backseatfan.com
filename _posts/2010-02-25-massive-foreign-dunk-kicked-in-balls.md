    I can't tell you who the teams are, or what language it is, or who it was. This was in the youtube info <span>Carmatic Pistoia - Bialetti Scafati, so that might mean something? </span> I just know it was a massive dunk, and the defender got kicked in the balls. Little surprised the announcer didn't say &#8220;GGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOALLLL&#8221; I thought they did that for all sports.
