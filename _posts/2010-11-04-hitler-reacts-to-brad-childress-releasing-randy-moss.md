    This is pretty much how I reacted, minus speaking in german, and I did not buy a Moss jersey. I really don't want to even pay attention to the Vikings until Childress is fired. Does it really matter that he is a terrible teammate?  Does Brett Favre practice everyday?  Is a pain in the ass?  Of course he is, but you don't cut him.  Randy Moss opened up the middle for Harvin. Now you are fucked.  Fire Brad Childress.<br />
