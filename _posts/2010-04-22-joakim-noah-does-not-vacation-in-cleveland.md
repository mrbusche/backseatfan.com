    Joakim Noah had a few good statements after losing to Cleveland in game 2. Let's face it, this is pretty damn true. Unless you are making a trip to the Rock and Roll hall of fame, I'm not sure why you would want to go to Cleveland. Maybe you have family there? Doing a tour of all of the baseball stadiums? Joakim Noah speaks the truth, please send him somebody to Chicago to help him beat Cleveland next year.
