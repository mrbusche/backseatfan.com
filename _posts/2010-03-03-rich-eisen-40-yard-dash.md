    Will Al Davis be calling Rich Eisen? I think so. His suit probably slows him down a bit, He might want to go in all Under Armour gear next year. The best is when they compare him to other athletes. I think NFL coaches should be required to do these drills. Anyone else want to see Andy Reid run a 40?
