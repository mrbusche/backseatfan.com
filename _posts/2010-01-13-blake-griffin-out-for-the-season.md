  <p>
    Griffin, the first overall selection in the 2009 NBA Draft, suffered a non-displaced stress fracture of his left patella during the Clippers' last preseason game vs. the New Orleans Hornets on October 23rd.
  </p>

  <p>
    On December 23rd, Griffin had a CT Scan and MRI and was cleared to increase his rehabilitation workload.
  </p>

  <p>
    Griffin experienced some discomfort during his new accelerated rehab program. Doctors have determined Griffin will need to have season ending surgery with a recovery length of four to six months.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sorry Clippers, you can't catch a break.
