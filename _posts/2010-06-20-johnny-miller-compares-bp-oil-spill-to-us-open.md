    NBC golf analyst Johnny Miller compared the  uneven play at the U.S. Open to the BP oil spill.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "I don't know who's leaking more oil: the field or British Petroleum."
    </p>
  </blockquote>

    Probably a little bit too soon Johnny, but still good color commentary.

    Some guy named Graeme McDowell won the Us Open.  Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson tied for 4th place, seven strokes behind McDowell.<br />
