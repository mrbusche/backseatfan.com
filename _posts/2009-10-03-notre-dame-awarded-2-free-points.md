    The Washington Huskies have defeated Notre Dame in a thriller in South Bend.
  </p>

  <p>
    No, actually they haven't, they're playing overtime because the officials can't get calls right. Let me set the scene, Notre Dame just drove down and scored a touchdown to take the lead and decides to go for 2 to give themselves a 3 point lead. Robert Hughes gets a direct snap and appears to score but if the booth had reviewed the play Hughes knee was clearly down. Locker drives the Huskies down the field and Eric Folk kicks a 37 yard field goal to tie the game in what should be a regulation victory for the Huskies.

    I find it funny that the play was replayed numerous times and the announcers didn't notice his knee was down.

    No video yet, but once I get one I'll put it up.
