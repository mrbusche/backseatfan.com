    Here is a statement from Brett Favre off of his <a href="http://www.officialbrettfavre.com/">website</a>
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I want to thank all of my fans for a memorable season. While the season didn't end in Miami as we had all hoped, I couldn't have enjoyed this season any more than I did.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I decided to return to the NFL to play my 19th season, I did so with some trepidation. After all, I was joining a new team in a new city, for the archrivals of the â€œgreen and gold.â€ And I'm not getting any younger.
    </p>

    <p>
      I couldn't be happier about my decision. The coaches, staff, and especially teammates who joined me in the season's journey are true professionals, and better yet, friends. I felt completely comfortable from day one as a member of the Minnesota Vikings, and it's a tribute to the entire organization that accepted me with open arms. It was truly an amazing experience to be a part of the Minnesota Vikings this past season.
    </p>

    <p>
      And to the fans â€“ those in Minnesota, in Wisconsin, and across the country â€“ I want to express my heartfelt thanks for all of the support and goodwill that you've shown me, Deanna, and the girls throughout the season. It's truly humbling to know that so many of you are pulling for us.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of what the future holds, I want everyone to know that I will cherish the memories of the past year for the rest of my life." -Brett Favre

    So I don't think that is a good sign for Favre Fan's out there. Sounds like he is going to retire (again). But Chances are he will drag it out, and retire and un-retire again.

  <p>
    Hopefully he will come back, he makes watching football better, plain and simple.
