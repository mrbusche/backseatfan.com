    Brett Favre recently had an <a href="https://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/07/vikings-qb-brett-favre-no-timetable-ankles-not-where-i-would-like-it-to-be/1">interview with USA Today</a>, I thought I would break down everything Favre says?<br /> <strong>Quote:</strong>
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "If I could guarantee it, I would," Favre said. "Obviously, I can't make people understand what I'm going through."
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <strong>Reaction:</strong><br /> Favre can't guarantee he is coming back, that means that he would be required to show up for training camp right away.  He needs time to mow his lawn, do some wrangler commercials, and play catch with some high school kids.  You don't know what he is going through, because you have never been through a training camp.  I didn't like 2 a days in high school, they were tough, I imagine NFL would be slightly harder than those.

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "The deadline? I don't know," Favre said. "There obviously comes a point where you've probably gone too far, where you just have to move on. He hopes I make the right decision for myself - one way or the other."<br /> <strong> </strong>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <strong> </strong>Deadline?  Childress knows he is coming back.  He just doesn't know if it will be for the 3rd preseason game or the 4th preseason game.  He went to far if he totally forgot to show up for preseason.  He needs to make some sort of apperance, a few practice downs, just so he gets warmed up for the Saints.  He wants to make sure he makes the right decsion so he doesn't have to work that hard in preseason.  Working too hard would be a terrible decsion for a 40 year old QB.<br /> <strong> </strong>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong> </strong>"Our visit was great. I think the world of him (and) his patience. He and I joked about how there were some rocky times (between them) last year. All of a sudden, we weren't sittin' on the front porch anymore BS-ing. But any good team has that. We're both competitors, that happens."

  <p>
    <strong> </strong>Childress visit with Favre went great, they joked about how Favre was going to dangle out his comeback to the media.  They probably figured out the exact moment he was going to come back.  Then they starting talking about how they are going to be crazy this year, and win a super bowl.

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "After almost nine weeks, it's not where I would like it to be, but I'm working at it," he said. "Maybe it never gets to where I want it to be. Forty years old … three surgeries … that's all you need to know.'"
    </p>

    This is what he was waiting for.  A chance to say his ankle isn't quite there yet.  So now Favre has a valid excuse to miss most of training camp.  Hook, Line, Sinker.  Favre can fish for a few more weeks.  He doesn't want to give any more details, because he doesn't want anyone to figure out how good his ankle actually is.

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Favre had no comment regarding a Men's Journal story that quoted his agent, Bus Cook, as being angry for the quarterback previously discussing his need for ankle surgery with ESPN. Cook called Favre a "drama queen."

  <p>
    <strong> </strong>Favre had no comment because well? He is a drama queen, and Bus Cook was probably acting for the reporter.  It was a pretty aww shucks interview from what I read in the highlights.  I will read the entire Q&A this weekend to get the rest of it.
