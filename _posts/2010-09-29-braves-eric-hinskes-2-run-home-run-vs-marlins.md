    Atlanta Braves OF Eric Hinske hits an emotional 2 run home run vs the Marlins to keep the Braves in front in the NL Wild Card race.

    As you all know MLB.com doesn't allow their videos to be embedded and they take down anything on youtube, so <a href="https://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100928&content_id=15192390&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb">click here for the link</a>.

    Eric Hinske and Brooks Conrad provided clutch hits in the Braves 3-1 victory over the Marlins Tuesday night. Conrad hit a <a href="https://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=12544047&topic_id=8879214&c_id=mlb">triple to deep center</a> in which CF Cameron Maybin was injured.

    As they say in the video, this is Eric Hinske's time of the year, he has been to the past 3 world series winning 2 of them.
