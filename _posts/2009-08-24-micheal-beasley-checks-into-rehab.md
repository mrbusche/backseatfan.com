  <p>
    Miami Heat forward Micheal Beasley checked himself into rehab this week in Houston to address a possible substance problem.  If you look in the photo below that he posted on his Twitter account, Beasley is trying to show his followers a new tattoo on his shoulders. What Beasley didn't realize is that the image also captured what appeared to be a small plastic bag on the table next to him. You can't tell what the contents are, but it could possibly be drugs. It is kind of a hazzy photo anyway. You do the math.

    Beasley's Twitter account has since been closed. Coincidence. I think not.

    I Hope that Beasley can get his crap together, best of luck to him in rehab.
