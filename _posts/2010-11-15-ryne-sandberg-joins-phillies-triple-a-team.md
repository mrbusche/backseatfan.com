<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Former Chicago Cubs second baseman Ryne Sandberg, who was passed over by the Cubs as the team's next managers has agreed to become manager of the Philadelphia Phillies' Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the International League.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sandberg had long been considered the favorite to replace Lou Piniella but the Cubs chose Mike Quade who was named interim manager in August and led the Cubs to a 24-13 record after the legendary manager retired for family reasons.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sandberg had been a fixture in the Des Moines area as manager of the Iowa Cubs doing a ton of charity and promotional work in the area. He will be sorely missed in the community not to mention the team he guided to an 82-62 record and first place in the PCL Northern Division this year.
