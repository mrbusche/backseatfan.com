  <p>
    <br /> Jon Gruden seemed to be reading a text to Mel Kiper saying &#8220;It's a crazy league a lot of dumbass&#8230;&#8221; Coaches. I am pretty sure he says coaches. If only Berman didn't interrupt him. But what exactly is he referring to? Probably Denver taking Tim Tebow. I love Jon Gruden, so entertaining.
