    Pat Tillman's brother Richard Tillman is very passionate about Pat. He went off on a few rants during this interview, but it makes it that much better. The Pat Tillman movie is out, as well as this new book. It is an intriguing story, not just because Pat was an NFL player, but because of what actually happened. I have yet to see the movie, but I will catch it on Netflix for sure.

    The clip from the memorial service is fantastic (6 minutes in). Be sure you at least watch that, but the whole interview is great.
