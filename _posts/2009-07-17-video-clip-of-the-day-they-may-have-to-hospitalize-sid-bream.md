    As we approach the 1 year anniversary of legendary announcer Skip Caray's death I think it is fitting we share his most famous call from the 1992 National League Championship series.

    &#8220;A lotta room in right-center, if he hits one there we can dance in the streets. The 2-1. Swung, line drive left field! One run is in! Here comes Bream! Here's the throw to the plate! He is&#8230;safe! Braves win! Braves win! Braves win! Braves win!&#8230;Braves win! They may have to hospitalize Sid Bream; he's down at the bottom of a huge pile at the plate. They help him to his feet. Frank Cabrera got the game winner! The Atlanta Braves are National League champions again! This crowd is going berserk, listen!&#8221;

    I'll never forget watching this game at my grandparents' house and seeing a side of my grandfather I had never seen, a 65 year old man jumping up and down cheering at the television, little did I know nearly 20 years later I would become that same guy.
