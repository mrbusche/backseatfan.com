    It turns out that ESPN's Jeremy Green admitted to police that he was a cocaine user.  Which might explain his off the wall-ness during Football Today Podcasts.  They also found more than 50 images of child pornography on his laptop.

    Green was charged by warrant with first-degree possession of child pornography, possession of narcotics and possession of drug paraphernalia by Bristol police. He is currently being held on a $750,000 bond payable in cash only.  His court hearing will be on July 20th.

    This doesn't look or sound good for Jeremy Green, I don't think his career will make it past this one.  The question is? Will ESPN report on it?  Probably not.  But hey Fox and CBS will probably be all over it!

  <p>
    When this was first reported by the Bristol Press they didn't give any affiliation to ESPN with Jeremy Green.  Looks like they finally gave ESPN their due with the latest article.
