    Since Ted Williams now works for the Cleveland Cavs I think it is OK for me to post it on a sports blog.  OK, In would have posted it either way, I just didn't really listen to the story until yesterday.  Jimmy Fallon Video is at the bottom.  For those of you who don't  know who this Ted Williams is, you have been living under a rock like I have.

    Ted Williams was a homeless man holding a street sign that said he had a Golden Voice. I hope he does well, and stays clean, just watch the videos below and you will understand.
