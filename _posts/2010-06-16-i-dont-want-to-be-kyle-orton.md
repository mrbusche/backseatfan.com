    This is one smart kid. You don't want to pretend you are a terrible QB, you want to be a NFL star. You especially don't want to be Kyle Orton. You don't want to pretend to be ousted by Tim Tebow this year. You don't want to pretend have a neck beard. You just don't want to pretend to be a mediocre NFL QB. It's just not fun.
