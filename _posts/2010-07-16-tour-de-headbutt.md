    Mark Renshaw was ejected from the Tour de France on Thursday after headbutting New Zealand cyclist Julian Dean. In last sprint of the 11th stage, Renshaw headbutted Dean at least three times. Renshaw was thrown out for the greater good of the team. Mark Cavendish won the stage soley because of the headbutt. Yes, this is my second post on Tour de France this year, a new Backseat Fan record. Amazing.
