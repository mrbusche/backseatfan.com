  <p>
    Steve Blake has agreed to a four-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers according to<a href="http://twitter.com/JohnCanzanoBFT/status/17604108306"> The Oregonian</a>'s John Canzano.
  </p>

  <p>
    The contract will pay Blake $16 million over the next four season. He will be paid an even $4 million each season.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Lakers had a need at PG after Derek Fisher, Jordan Farmar and Shannon Brown all became free agents this off season. The Lakers reportedly offered Fisher a one year, $2.5 million contract, that he turned down and he has reportedly been in talks with the Heat and Cavaliers. The Lakers were not expected to make a contract offer to Jordan Farmar.
