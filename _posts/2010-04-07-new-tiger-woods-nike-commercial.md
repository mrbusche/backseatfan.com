    Nike's new ad features the voice of the Tiger's late father, Earl Woods. The commercial is titled “Earl and Tiger”, it says a lot about Tiger and his current situation. It will be airing on ESPN and the Golf Channel during the Masters. I find it kind of creepy having his deceased dad scold him. But they need an ice breaker like this, they can't just start selling Tiger right away.
