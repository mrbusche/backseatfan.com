<div class="entry">
  <p>
    We're going to start a weekly feature tracking who we feel are the current leaders for MVP, Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards.
  </p>

  <p>
    American League<br /> MVP<br /> 1. Prince Fielder<br /> 2. Lance Berkman<br /> 3. Chris Davis
  </p>

  <p>
    Hard to find a real stand out player this early in the season, but Prince Fielder has been his always consistent self. Chris Davis started off hot and Lance Berkman has been solid in a DH role for the Rangers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cy Young<br /> 1. Clay Buchholz<br /> 2. Justin Masterson<br /> 3. Anibal Sanchez
  </p>

  <p>
    Buchholz and Masterson have both been unreal through 3 starts, but it's doubtful we see either of these players on this list two weeks from now.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rookie of the Year<br /> 1. Matt Dominguez
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyone know a site that lists current rookies? All I could come up with in the AL is Dominguez, Hicks and Jackie Bradley Jr. The latter two obviously not worthy of votes.
  </p>

  <p>
    National League<br /> MVP<br /> 1. Justin Upton<br /> 2. Bryce Harper<br /> 3. Brandon Phillips
  </p>

  <p>
    There's no hotter team in baseball and they've been led by a monster tear by Upton to start the season. Bryce Harper and Phillips have started off hot, with their teams following their lead as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cy Young<br /> 1. Matt Harvey<br /> 2. Clayton Kershaw<br /> 3. Paul Maholm
  </p>

  <p>
    Harvey has been ridiculous thus far and the Mets have started off surprisingly well through 11 games. Kershaw is obviously a stud and Maholm should be a great pitcher for the Braves all year
  </p>

  <p>
    Rookie of the Year<br /> 1. Evan Gattis<br /> 2. Jose Fernandez
  </p>

  <p>
    Once again, hard to find players this early in the season who are considered rookies. El Oso Blanco has been beasting and Jose Fernandez has been the lone bright spot for an awful Marlins team.
