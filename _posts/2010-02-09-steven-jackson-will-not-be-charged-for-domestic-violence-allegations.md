    Rams RB Steven Jackson will not be charged after investigation into domestic violence allegations.
  </p>

    The St. Louis Ram's ex-girlfriend had alleged that Jackson beat her when she was nine months pregnant until she was 'bleeding heavily'. Jackson denied the claims and called the accusations untrue and said they were "especially hurtful because those who truly know me know that those actions would be out of character for me"

    Las Vegas police say there's simply not enough evidence to move forward with the case.

    Cops say they spoke with Supriya Harris,Jackson and witnesses before closing the case.<span style="font-size: x-small;"><span><br /> </span></span>

    Hopefully this news is front page like the accusations were. It's a sad society we live in when athletes are guilty until proven innocent and even when proven innocent no one knows because it's pushed to back page news.
