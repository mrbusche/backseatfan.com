    The Philadelphia Phillies placed CF Shane Victorino on the 15-day disabled listed and called up highly touted prospect Domonic Brown from AAA Lehigh Valley. The 22 year old started tonight's game against the Diamondbacks andÂ went 2-3 with a 2B, a sacrifice fly, and 2 RBI.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before the game today Brown said, &#8220;I'm pretty nervous, but a good nervous. I'm trying to get the first game under my belt and get rolling.&#8221; Brown shook off any nerves he had tonight in his first at bat an RBI double off the right field wall.

  <p>
    How Brown plays in the next couple days could affect what the Phillies do with Jayson Werth. Werth has been dangled in trade talks most of the month and the Phillies were expect to call up Brown to take his place on the roster.
  </p>

  <p>
    Brown should be an immediate add in any 12 team or deeper leagues and if you have an extra roster spot he's worth a spot in a 10 team league as well.
