    Nyjer Morgan thought this was a home run ball, and it was, sort of. He thought the ball bounced over the fence, so he spiked his glove on the ground like a baby. Turns out he was wrong, it bounced off the fence. Instead of a home run Nyjer gave up a four base error - in the park home run to Adam Jones.
