    Chris Bosh broke his face just 2 minutes into the Cavaliers game.
  </p>

  <p>
    Chris Bosh was hit by an accidental elbow from Antawn Jamison during the Raptors - Cavaliers game. He went to the floor with blood dripping from his nose and mouth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bosh was taken to a nearby hospital where X-rays confirmed that he broke his face. The official injury is a 'maxilla and nasal fracture to the right side of his face'.
  </p>

  <p>
    He could be out anywhere between a few days or a few weeks. This is not good for the Raptors, who are trying to get into the playoffs. Â They are clinging onto the 8 seed, and will have a tough time hanging there without Bosh.
