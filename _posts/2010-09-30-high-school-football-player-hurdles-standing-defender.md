    Marky Thompkins of the East Liverpool Potters (Ohio) jumps over a STANDING defender for a touchdown. The was a penalty on the play, so the touchdown didn't count. For some reason hurdling a player who has one or two feet on the ground is a penalty. I call that skill, not a penalty. OK, so the kid that he hurdled was about 5 foot 2, but the defender was going for a good form tackle right?

    Thompkins is a man among boys out there, I just found this video, where he just steals the ball from the runner, and takes it to the house. This kid has some athleticism, expect him to play at the next level.
