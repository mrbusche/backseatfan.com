    &#8220;We are saddened and shocked to hear the news of Steve McNair's passing today,&#8221; Titans owner K.S. &#8220;Bud&#8221; Adams Jr. said in a statement. &#8220;He was one of the finest players to play for our organization and one of the most beloved players by our fans. He played with unquestioned heart and leadership and led us to places that we had never reached, including our only Super Bowl. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family as they deal with his untimely passing.&#8221;

    The Houston Oilers picked McNair with the third overall selection in the 1995 draft. He played 10 seasons with the Oilers/Titans and 2 more with the Baltimore Ravens. He was a 3 time pro bowl selection and was the 2003 Co-AP NFL MVP
