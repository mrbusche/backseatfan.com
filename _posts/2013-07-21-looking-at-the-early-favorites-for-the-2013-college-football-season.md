    College football is a mere 6 weeks away and it's time to look at who some of the week 1 betting favorties are. USC heads to Hawaii on August 29th on what is sure to be a sizable blow out even against Hawaii's usually high powered offense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Buffalo University heads to Columbus to face The Ohio State Buckeyes in another game that is sure to be a blowout. Urban Meyer has a great recruiting class coming in and they will easily trounce the Bulls on Saturday August 31st.

    <a href="https://www.sportsinteraction.com/football/ncaa-betting-lines/">At this sports betting site</a>Â I found a couple other great bets for opening weekend. Massachusetts travel to Wisconsin, Central Michigan heads to Ann Arbor to face the Wolverines and Mississippi State heads to Stillwater to face the Cowboys of Oklahoma State. Regardless of the line I'm taking the points for all 3 of the home teams there.
  </p>

  <p>
    One road team I like to pull the upset week 1 is Northern Illinois traveling to Iowa. Iowa has the name recognition that says they're a great football school, but they haven't been able to put it together for years and Coach Ferentz would be sniffing the hot seat if not for a contract that runs through 2021.

    What are some of your favorite bets early in the college football season?
