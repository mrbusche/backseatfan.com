<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Before taking the Wonderlic exam, the person administering the test needs to read instructions, after those were read Tim Tebow had a personal request.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tebow requested everyone to bow their heads in prayer before taking the Wonderlic exam.
  </p>

  <p>
    One player said to "Shut the Fuck Up." And the room of players laughed (and sighed in relief because they wanted to say the same thing).
  </p>

  <p>
    So it turns out that ESPN is wrong, and not everyone loves Tebow as much as they do. Who knew?
  </p>

  <p>
    Not everyone is religious, and Tebow needs to learn that, and maybe learn how to not be a douchebag.
  </p>

  <p>
    But all of a sudden I am getting more religious by"Please God, don't let the Vikings draft Tebow."
