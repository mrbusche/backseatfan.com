    "Esteban out people, sunday please hurry up so I can crowd surf like a rock start-fans please toss me back on to the sideline when done."

    So it sounds like the superstar is vowing to crowd surf if he scores a touchdown this Sunday at home vs Cincinnati. Here's to hoping he scores so we can see what could be the greatest touchdown celebration of all time.

    Do you guys like Chad's antics? It seems to me that everything he does is more fun and he's having a lot more fun than last year (could be just the winning) but I like it. I don't think the No Fun League will feel the same on Monday morning though
