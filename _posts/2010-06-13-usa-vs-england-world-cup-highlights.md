    USA vs England 2010 World Cup Highlights. The game ended in a 1-1 draw, which to me feels worse than a loss. I just don't understand ending games in draws, can't they have extra innings in soccer?

    The USA goal was pretty lucky, but hey, a goal is a goal.<br /> <strong>USA goal</strong>:<br />
