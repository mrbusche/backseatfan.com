<div class="entry">
  <p>
    The Big Ten has announced their two divisions, 'Legends' and 'Leaders'.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Legends will be Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan St, Minnesota, Nebraska and Northwestern.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Leaders will be Illinois, Indiana, Ohio State, Penn State, Purdue and Wisconsin.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have to say it looks like they were thinking about coming up with a new conference name for the past 6 months and forgot about naming the divisions and then forgot to come up with a new name too.

  <p>
    Here is the new Big Ten logo, I'm sorry to say but Â it looks like it was designed by a 12 year old girl
