    Madden 2011 Trailer - Simple. Quicker. Deeper.
  </p>

  <p>
    New play calling, Quicker play calling cutting games in half, and Deeper gameplay. I just really hope they worked on the gameplay. We haven't seen a really good Madden in a long time. I really don't want it to be too simple. I really don't want it to be too quick. But I do want it to to be deeper. Please be good, I buy two games every year, Call of Duty and Madden, don't let me waste $60 again.

    Madden will be out on August 10, 2010
