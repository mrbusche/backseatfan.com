    Houston beating the Trail Blazers prevented us from going a perfect 8-0 in the first round. Here are our Conference Semifinals Picks
  </p>

  <h3>
    Eastern Conference
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>1 Cleveland Cavalies vs 4 Atlanta Hawks</strong> - I don't see any way the Cavaliers don't win this series. I think Atlanta may get lucky and win a game in Atlana but nothing more than that. <strong>Cavaliers in 5</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>2 Boston Celtics vs 3 Orlando Magic</strong> - This series going 7 games is exactly what Cleveland needs to be rested going into the NBA Finals and I think they will get exactly that. Dwight Howard will be eager to prove himself worthy of being one of the best big men in the NBA and I think he will have a dominant series. I also think Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Rajon Rondo will all keep the Celtics very competitive in this series and I think the new big three will the Celtics to victory. <strong>Celtics in 7</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Western Conference
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>1 Los Angeles Lakers vs 5 Houston Rockets</strong> - I think this is a trap series for the Lakers and if they think the Rockets are going to lie down they are crazy. Yao Ming and Ron Artest were great in their first round series vs Portland and I think they continue that in this series. I healthy Kobe Bryant would make this a Lakers victory in 6 but I think the Rockets push this to 7 and leave the Lakers reeling into the Conference Finals. <strong>Lakers in 7</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>2 Denver Nuggets vs 6 Dallas Mavericks</strong> - Both teams have been playing great but the Nuggets already boast a game 1 victory over the Mavs. Dirk Nowitzki will need to repeat his game one performance each game this series if the Mavericks are going to have any chance to win. I think the difference in this series is going to be the play of Chris Andersen. If he can play strong defense like in game one the Nuggets will win this series. <strong>Nuggets in 6</strong>.
