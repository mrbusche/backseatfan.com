    Thomas just finished his 37th season of coaching. He has a career record of 292-84, including 156-31 as Aplington-Parkersburg's head coach. He has won two state titles - 1993 and 2001.
  </p>

  <p>
    Altogether Thomas has led A-P to 19 state playoff appearances. Thomas' win total ranks ninth all-time amongst Iowa high school football coaches, Thomas originally began his coaching career at Northeast Hamilton in Blairsburg. In 2003 he was the NFL High School Coach of the Year.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coach Thomas has four former players active in the NFL &#8212; Brad Meester of Jacksonville; Jared DeVries; Casey Wiegmann of Denver; Aaron Kampman of Green Bay. DeVries, a defensive end with the Lions, walked off the field in Allen Park, Mich., toward the end of a morning practice, apparently shaken. Team officials said DeVries was not immediately available for comment.

  <p>
    Thomas made national headlines last year when he insisted that the high school's football field, named in his honor, be rebuilt as a way to help restore community pride in Parkersburg after it was hit by a powerful tornado in May 2008 that killed six people and destroyed the high school.
  </p>

  <p>
    Former Cyclones head coach Dan McCarney, now an assistant coach at Florida, told the Register he remembered his association with Thomas fondly.
  </p>

  <p>
    &#8220;When Ed said a kid could play, you knew that the kid was going to be a player. Even if Ed said he had someone that might be worth a look as a walk-on, you made a special trip up there to see him. Ed's one of the nicest people I've ever known. He had so much class, and so much character.&#8221;
  </p>

  <p>
    As high school players Ryan and I played against Coach Ed Thomas and although they beat us every time we played, it was an honor to play against a legendary coach such as himself. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family as well as the Aplington-Parkersburg community which had just begun recovering from the tornado in May 2008
