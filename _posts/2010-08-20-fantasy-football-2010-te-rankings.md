  <p>
    This year there are 7 elite Tight Ends and 5 or 6 more that will be fantasy starters this year. If you're in a 12 team league that mean you can be the last team to take a TE and you can still get a good starter. This year more than any year I'm not taking a top 5 Tight End
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>1. Antonio Gates, SD</strong> - The lack of Vincent Jackson for at least 3 weeks means Gates will be the #1 receiver on that team for the first 3 weeks and even when Jackson is back he'll still the most targets of any tight tend.<br /> <strong> 2. Jermichael Finley, GB</strong> - He had at least 70 yards in 5 of his last 6 games and should see his TDs approach double digits<br /> <strong>3. Dallas Clark, Ind</strong> - Clark is part of the best offense in football (at least top 2) and is always a focal point, it will be hard for him to repeat his 10 TDs from last year though<br /> <strong> 4. Jason Witten, Dal</strong> - Only has 2 TDs last year which is sure to go up this year. Money in the bank for 1,000 yards and 90 catches.<br /> <strong> 5. Brent Celek, Phi</strong> - Celek will be the safety blanket for first year QB Kevin Kolb<br /> <strong> 6. Vernon Davis, SF</strong> - Fantasy zombie Vernon Davis rose from the dead last year, but don't expect a repeat of his 13 TDs.<br /> <strong> 7. Tony Gonzalez, Atl</strong> - With Michael Turner and Harry Douglas healthy I think his production drops off this year.<br /> <strong> 8. Zach Miller, Oak</strong> - For the first time in his career he'll have a TD who can get him the ball and it will be Jason Campbell, a QB who loves the tight end.<br /> <strong> 9. Kellen Winslow, TB</strong> - Winslow didn't have a TD in the last 8 weeks, but had at least 4 catches each week<br /> <strong>10. Visanthe Shiancoe, Min</strong> - All he does is catch touchdowns and that will continue this season<br /> <strong> 11. Chris Cooley, Was</strong> - McNabb has made a living checking down to his TEs.<br /> <strong> 12. Owen Daniels, Hou </strong>- Daniels has top 5 potential, but he still hasn't practiced this year and that worries me.<br /> <strong> 13. Heath Miller, Pit</strong> - He had career highs in first downs and TDs last year, Big Ben being out actually helps his value.<br /> <strong> 14. Dustin Keller, NYJ</strong> - Keller had a TD in each of the Jets' playoff games last year, he worth a flier if you take a backup.<br /> <strong> 15. Greg Olsen, Chi</strong> - Mike Martz doesn't care of the TE much, but Olsen is still a big target in the red zone.<br /> <strong> 16. Jeremy Shockey, NO</strong> - If he can stay healthy he'll be a fantasy starter, I'm not convinced he can stay healthy though.<br /> <strong> 17. Todd Heap, Bal</strong> - He's a capable bye week fill in, but Ed Dickson will push him for playing time.<br /> <strong> 18. Jermaine Gresham, Cin</strong> - When was the last time the Bengals had a good tight end, fantasy or real life? I can't remember either. Gresham has a shot at 600 yards this year<br /> <strong> 19. John Carlson, Sea</strong> - If Charlie Whitehurst earns the starting job sometime this year Carlson could repeat his 7 TDs of 2009.<br /> <strong> 20. Kevin Boss, NYG</strong> - With the terrible offensive line last year the Giants made boss stay in and block rather than catch passes.
