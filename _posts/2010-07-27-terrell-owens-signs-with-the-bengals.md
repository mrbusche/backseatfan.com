  <p>
    Terrell Owens will sign with the Cincinnati Bengals on a 1 year $2 M with a possible of $2 M in incentives. It is going to be TO and Ocho show. I really like this move for the Bengals. TO has a little bit left in his tank, and both Chad Ochocinco and Terrell Owens will benefit from each other. TO needed to go to a place where there was veteran QB that he couldn't corrupt. Since Carson Palmer can already handle Chad Ochocinco, then he should be able to handle the antics of Terrell Owens as well.

  <p>
    According to @<a href="http://twitter.com/Adam_Schefter" target="_blank">Adam_Schefter</a>: T.O.'s incentives: 60 catches - 333k; 100 C - 333k; 900 yds - 333k; 1300 yds - 333k; 10TD-333k; 14TD-333k. Total $2 mil.

  <p>
    But didn't TO say he would change his name to Ocho Uno if he went to the Bengals?
  </p>

  <p>
    Yes he did, I want to see that name change damn it!
