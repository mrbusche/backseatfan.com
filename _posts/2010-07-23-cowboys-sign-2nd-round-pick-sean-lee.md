  <p>
    Dallas Cowboy's Inside linebacker Sean Lee has agreed to terms on a four-year contract. Lee was a second round pick out of Penn State, he was the 55th overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. The cowboys traded a 4th round pick to move up to grab Lee.

  <p>
    Financial terms for the 4 year contract are currently undisclosed. We will update the <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2010/04/2010-nfl-draft-rookie-signing-status/">signings page</a> as soon as we hear them.
  </p>

  <p>
    All of the Dallas Cowboys NFL Draft picks have signed, and will all be reporting for the first day of training camp. The Cowboys are the second team to sign all of their draft picks, with the Bears being the only other team.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lee should make an impact this year with the Cowboys. He will primarily be a back up, but could be used in nickel coverage and special teams. Wade Phillips has said he expects the rookie to get significant playing time this season.
