    Violence at a soccer game? That is unheard of. Blasphemy I say!

    Brazil Coach Emerson Leao after a draw, two players jumped in into the fight as well. It's weird, at NFL games you don't see a lot of riot gear on the field preventing fights between teams / reporters. Different culture I guess?
