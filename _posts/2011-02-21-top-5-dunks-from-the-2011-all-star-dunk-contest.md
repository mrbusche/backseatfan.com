    There were a lot of great dunks on Saturday night.  But did the best dunk win?  Let's go through the top 5 dunks during the all star dunk contest.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>5. Blake Griffin Car Dunk</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong> </strong>A Solid dunk, with a lot of showmanship, but this was not the best dunk of the night.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>4. JaVale McGee Dunks 3 Balls</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This was pretty impressive, and it really showed off his quick hands
  </p>

  <p>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>3. Blake Griffin 360</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong> </strong>This was a powerhouse 360 dunk.  Not much flair, just pure awesomeness.
  </p>

  <p>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>2. JaVale McGee's Two Ball Dunk</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Everyone thought he was going to go with a higher rim, but the double dunk is way better than a higher rim.
  </p>

  <p>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>1. Serge Ibaka Jumps from the Foul Line</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Ok, by far this is the best dunk, both Micheal Jordan and Dr J were before the free throw line.  Serge was behind it, he wins.
