    A fan fell from the 2nd deck of Rangers Ballpark while reaching for a foul ball last night. The fan fell from the club level in section 235, hit the railing on the suite level, then landed on the lower deck below. He dropped approximately 30 feet.

    Reports say that the man was stable, and was moving all of his extremities. He was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth. Four other fans were injured, and treated at the stadium. The game was stopped for 16 minutes, and apparently didn't feel like a baseball game the rest of the game.

    In the video below you can feel the silence and the concern of the crowd, and see the reactions of the players that saw it.
