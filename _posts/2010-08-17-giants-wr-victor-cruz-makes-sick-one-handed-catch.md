    Undrafted WR Victor Cruz made a sick catch for the Giants on Monday Night.

    The NFL doesn't allow videos to be embedded, so  for better quality head on over to <a href="https://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/09000d5d819cf7c2/Pre-Week-1-Can-t-Miss-Play-Crazy-catch-Cruz">NFL.com for the video</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cruz caught 6 passes for 145 yards and 3 TDs, 2 TD passes from Jim Sorgi and one from third-string QB Rhett Bomar.

  <p>
    The catch was good enough for Cruz to get a <a href="https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/21367213750">shoutout on twitter</a> from LeBron James, "Victor Cruz going nuts on the Jets tonight on <a title="#MNF" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MNF">#MNF</a>. Undrafted rookie from UMass. He's gonna have a job this year for sure," James tweeted.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Giants already had a pretty deep WR corps with Steve Smith, Hakeem Nicks, Mario Manningham, Sinorice Moss, and Domenik Hixon all entering training camp on the roster, but Hixon tore his ACL this summer which could leave a roster spot open for the sure handed Cruz.
