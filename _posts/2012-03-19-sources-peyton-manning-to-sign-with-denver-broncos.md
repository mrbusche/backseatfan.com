<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Sources have <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2012/03/sources-peyton-manning-to-sign-with-denver-broncos/">confirmed</a> to ESPN's Adam Schefter and Chris Mortenson that Peyton Manning will sign with the Denver Broncos. Contract details have not been announced, but the offer last week was believed to be 5 years $90 million with $30 million guaranteed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The contract would likely be fully guaranteed the first two years with an option for the Broncos to cut Peyton after 2 years if he is injured.
  </p>

  <p>
    With news that Daniel Fells will likely sign with the Patriots today I would say there is a 99% chance that Dallas Clark will be the next player the Broncos sign.
