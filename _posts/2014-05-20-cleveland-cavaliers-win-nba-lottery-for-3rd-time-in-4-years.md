<div class="entry">
  <p>
    The Cleveland Cavaliers, one of the most incomptent franchises of the past 4 years, won the lottery for the 3rd time in the last 4 years. The Cavaliers had just a 1.7% chance of winning the top pick.
  </p>

  <p>
    With Kyrie Irving, former #1 pick Anthony Bennett and potentially Joel Embiid the Cavaliers look like they could be a strong landing point for LeBron in 2014 or 2015.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Milwaukee Buck had a 25% chance of winning the top pick, but ended up with the 2nd selection while the 76ers earned the 3rd pick, but also have the 10th pick as part of a draft day trade last year.
