  <p>
    The Packers defeated the Eagles 27-20 today despite some second half heroics from Michael Vick.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kevin Kolb suffered a concussion during the second quarter on a tackle by Clay Mathews, it was a legal hit, but Kolb hit his head akwardly on the turf on the tackle.

  <p>
    Shortly after Kolb was hurt Stewart Bradley hit his head and got a concussion as well. This was not a game for the faint of heart or for either team and their health.
