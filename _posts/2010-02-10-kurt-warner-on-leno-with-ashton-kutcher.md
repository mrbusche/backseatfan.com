    So I am not a huge fan of Leno (I am for CoCo), but I like Kurt Warner and Ashton Kutcher. They are from Iowa (that's where I am from), and they do reference Hy-Vee grocery store (which was my first job). I do live in Arizona now, so following in Kurt's footsteps I guess, I just need to work on winning a Super Bowl. Or I guess I'll just cover it.

    Looks like Hy-Vee produces superstars, outlook looks good for me right? Backseat Fan was ESPN SportsNation's site we like of the day. So things are looking up.
