  <p>
    Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz were 2 of the 103 MLB players who tested positive in 2003 in the 'anonymous' tests according to lawyers at the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=/2009/07/31/sports/baseball/31doping.html&#038;OQ=_rQ3D5Q26hp&#038;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">New York Times</a>.

  <p>
    Major League Baseball tested all players in what were supposed to be anonymous tests. The tests were never destroyed (no idea why) and names have slowly been leaking out in the past 2 years.

  <p>
    If this is true, the legacy of David Ortiz, who has denied ever using steroids is now tarnished. As well as the legacy surrounding Manny Ramirez.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ortiz was asked on Thursday about the 2003 drug test â€œI'm not talking about that anymore,â€ he said. â€œI have no comment.â€

  <p>
    Are there any players who, if their names were released would surprise you? Ken Griffey Jr is the one I can think of. I think MLB needs to release the names of all 103 players who tested positive now, enough with the slow leaking of names to the media.

    The best part of today's revelations? It's Bud Seligs birthday! Happy 75th Bud!
