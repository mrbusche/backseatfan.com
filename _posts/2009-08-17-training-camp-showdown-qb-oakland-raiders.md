  <h3>
    Jeff Garcia vs JaMarcus Russell
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Jeff Garcia - Ryan</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    If the Oakland Raiders want to win the should be the starting Jeff Garcia at Quarterback. He did great last year considering that Tampa Bay had no running backs that were healthy and his coach hated him. In 2007 that he took the Bucs to the playoffs, and in 2006 he helped take the Eagles to the playoffs when McNabb went down. He is a good veteran QB, and Russell could benefit sitting behind him for a year. Oakland's young Wide Receivers would benefit by having a veteran QB, and Oakland's Running Backs would benefit the most by getting a chance to run wild. If Russell was the QB Defenses would just stack the box, and force Russell to throw. Garcia will be able to keep the defenses honest by giving the Raiders some sort of passing game. Garcia gives the Raiders the best chance to win. If you are an Oakland fan and want the Raiders to win more than 4 games, you better pray that Al Davis wants Garcia to start at Quarterback.

    <strong>JaMarcus Russell - Matt</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    He's getting paid an insane amount of money and he has a cannon for an arm. He also completed 62% of his passes in the last 3 games last year throwing 6 TDs to only 2 INT. He also had a QB Rating of 102 in those last 3 games. Russell has only started 17 games in his career and although his record isn't good (5-12) it takes at least 32 games to get acclimated to the pro game for most quarterbacks.

    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Russell defintely has the potential to be a good quarterback in the NFL but with Darius Heyward-Bey and Chaz Schilens as your best WRs it would be hard for anyone to win with this offense, even Peyton Manning or Drew Brees. Garcia should start at QB this year if the Raiders are looking to potentially get to 6 wins, he gives them the best shot this season. If the Raiders are smart and realize they won't make the playoffs this season they'll keep Russell in at quarterback and find out what he's made of.
