  <p>
    Bob Costas interviewed Jerry Sandusky this evening on NBC News' &#8220;Rock Center&#8221; with his attorneys blessing and I have to say this interview couldn't have gone worse for Sandusky unless he admitted to the acts.
  </p>

  <p>
    At one point Costas asks Sandusky if he was a pedophile and Sandusky responds, &#8220;No&#8221;. However when asked if he was sexually attracted to young boys Sandusky took 16 seconds to say that no, he was not.
