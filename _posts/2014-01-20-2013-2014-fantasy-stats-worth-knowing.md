    Fantasy stats worth knowing
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re hooked on fantasy sports, you should be clued up on your statistics. Here are a few you should know from the 2013 Fantasy Football season.
  </p>

  <p>
    -Denver is the new fantasy capitol with five players scoring at least 10 touchdowns in the same season. No other team has had more than three players with at least 10 end zone visits.
  </p>

  <p>
    -The most fantasy points scored in Week 1 came from Peyton Manning with 46.28 – the highest number since 1960 – resulting in new NFL records in passing yards (5,477) and touchdowns (55).
  </p>

  <p>
    -In contrast to Manning’s performance, the New York Jets finished the season with just 13 touchdown passes. Manning threw 14 in the fourth quarter alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    -In 2009, not a single quarterback rushed for 350-plus yards and one (Rodgers) rushed for five touchdowns. Six different signal-callers rushed for over 400 yards this past season.
  </p>

  <p>
    -Over the last three years, a combined 33 quarterbacks have thrown for over 3,900 yards including 11 this season. In the history of the Chicago Bears franchise, no quarterback has thrown for even 3,850 yards. Based on his numbers from the 11 games he played in 2013, Jay Cutler was projected to finish with 3,812 passing yards.
  </p>

  <p>
    - The highest rushing total a running back has ever had after a 2,000-yard season is Barry Sanders, who followed up his 2,053-yard campaign in 1997 with 1,491 yards the following season. The biggest drop in terms of yards was Terrell Davis, who missed all but four games the year after running for 2,008 yards on 392 carries in 1998.
  </p>

  <p>
    - Since 2009, no defense or special teams unit has finished No. 1 in fantasy points in back-to-back seasons. The San Francisco 49ers, who were the top fantasy defense in 2011, ranked seventh at the position the following season. That is the highest a defense has finished after ranking No. 1 the previous campaign during this time frame.
