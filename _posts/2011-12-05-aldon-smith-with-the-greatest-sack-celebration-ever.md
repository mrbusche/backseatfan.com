<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Aldon Smith gets the sack on 4th down and instead of celebrating on the field sprints to the sideline and takes a seat on the bench. I wish there was a better video of everyone else's reaction because it looks like his teammates were really confused why he was sprinting off the field.<br />
