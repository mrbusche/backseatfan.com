    The Celtics had it in the bag until the 3rd quarter when they started to give up their 13 point lead. The Lakers fought back and won the NBA Championship. Kobe gets his 5th Ring, and Phil Jackson gets his 11th ring. That is Phil Jackson's 11th Championship in 20 years as a head coach. That is just ridiculous. Kobe wins the MVP, as he should, since he is the Lakers team. The final score of the game is 83-79.
