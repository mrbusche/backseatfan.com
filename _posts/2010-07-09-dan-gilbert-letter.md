  <p>
    Dan Gilbert's Letter to the Fans is a kind of like this?.
  </p>

  <p>
    Have you ever had someone at work piss you off? And you type up an email bitching them out? Then you think? Wow, I should wait a while and reread this before i send it?
  </p>

  <p>
    Dan Gilbert just pressed send.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/news/gilbert_letter_100708.html">Dan Gilbert's letter was posted</a> on Cleveland website.  It was in size 16 font and in the worst font imaginable, Comic Sans.  Dan Gilbert got pissed, because he couldn't keep LeBron.
  </p>

  <p>
    How many free agents want to go to Cleveland now? Zero. No one will go there while he's the majority owner. He is terrible, and couldn't get anyone in Cleveland while LeBron was there.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      In the meantime, I want to make one statement to you tonight:
    </p>

    <p>
      "I PERSONALLY GUARANTEE THAT THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS WILL WIN AN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP BEFORE THE SELF-TITLED FORMER ‘KING’ WINS ONE"
    </p>

    <p>
      You can take it to the bank.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I don't understand how he can guarantee a title. He has no one. And no one will want to come to Cleveland. They get 15 wins next year.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can take it to the bank? Are tickets being refunded when LeBron wins a title before Cleveland? Expect to see a few fan lawsuits when that happens.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to talk about loyalty, why did Gilbert fire Mike Brown? Mike Brown led the team to consecutive 60 win seasons, sure they were the first team to have consecutive 60 win seasons and not win a title, but why fire him? Because Gilbert is from Detroit, Michigan and idolizes Tom Izzo. Don't throw stones if you live a glass house, Dan.
