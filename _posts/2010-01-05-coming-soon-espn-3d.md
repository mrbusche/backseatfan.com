    Let's face it, watching a 3D game on your 32&#8243; samsung TV isn't going to look very good. It will be cool, but it will be gimicky. If you have a theatre room, or a gigantic tv it will be awsome.

    I've heard experiences that it is like you are in the game. That is pretty amazing if you ask me. You will be able to get a stadium like experience, but no drunk loud fans yelling, puking, and stumbling all over you.
  </p>

  <p>
    So start building you Theater rooms, and buy your big screen TVs, because 3D sports is going to be coming soon to a home near you.
