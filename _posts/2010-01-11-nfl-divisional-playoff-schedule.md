  <p>
    Here is the lineup for the Divisional Round of the NFL Playoffs. The wildcard games were pretty solid, especially the Cardinals - Packers shootout. I expect the Arizona - New Orleans game to be pretty similar.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Saturday, Jan. 16</strong><br /> NFC: 4:30 p.m. ET â€” Arizona (10-6) at New Orleans (13-3) (FOX-TV)<br /> AFC: 8:15 p.m. ET â€” Baltimore (9-7) at Indianapolis (14-2) (CBS-TV)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Sunday, Jan. 17</strong><br /> NFC: 1 p.m. ET â€” Dallas (11-5) at Minnesota (12-4) (FOX-TV)<br /> AFC: 4:40 p.m. ET â€” New York Jets (9-7) at San Diego (13-3) (CBS-TV)
