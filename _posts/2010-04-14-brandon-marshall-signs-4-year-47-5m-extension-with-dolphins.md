    Marshall and the Dolphins reached agreement Wednesday on a four-year, $47.5 million contract extension that includes $24 million in guaranteed money, according to a <a href="https://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/draft10/news/story?id=5085644">league source</a>. The deal includes close to $29 million in the first three years of the contract and makes Marshall the highest paid receiver in NFL history. Larry Fitzgerald previously had the richest deal of any receiver, averaging $10 million per season.

    This ties back into my analyzing of the <a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2010/04/denver-broncos-trade-brandon-marshall-to-miami-dolphins/">Marshall trade</a>. I hope he can stay motivated now that he's getting paid. If he can't I would like to see him pull some antics this year like he did in Denver last year. It would be interesting to see what Bills Parcells would do to him.
