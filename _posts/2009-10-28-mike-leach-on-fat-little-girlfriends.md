    Not sure if this is the best way to take a loss, but it sure is a funny excuse. At least he didn't point out the players/girlfriends individually.<br /> <br /> Short Version
  </p>

    <br /> Full Version

  <p>
    Mike Leach blames <span>Texas Tech Coeds for the loss to Texas A&M. </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    You know the guys with the hot girlfriend will be calling out everyone's girlfriends. "Is coach talking about you? Pick it up."
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Not sure if that is the best way to get recruits either. "Come to Texas Tech Find yourself a </span><span> Fat Little Girlfriend".</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe he was using the slang, PHAT, - which is a little dated.
  </p>

  <p>
    The poor backup DT or backup Center with that fat little girlfriend won't be able to invite coach to their wedding.
  </p>

  <p>
    He made the player's home life worse. Every girlfriend is going to be pissed off, and asking if they are fat.
