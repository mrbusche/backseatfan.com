    According to Tom Pelissero of ESPN 1500. Brett Favre has an avulsion fracture and a stress fracture. He is a walking bootbut will not require surgery. Childress has not ruled out Favre making it back for the Patriots game this week, but it's not looking good.

    Childress said "the streak" would not play into the decision on Favre's status. "We have to do what's right for Minnesota Vikings," Childress said. Does that mean he's firing himself? Of course not, he will rob Zygi Wilf for 3 more years on the horrible extension he was signed to last year. Only 3 more years Vikings fans.

  <p>
    An avulsion fracture occurs when a ligament or tendon attached to a bone pulls away a piece of the bone. It sounds serious, but apparently is not as serious as it sounds. Not serious enough to rule Favre out for Sunday's game at least.

    Childress was asked if Favre had to practice for a chance to play against the Patriots, Childress said most players have to practice to play. (If there was ever going to be an exception Childress would make one for his son.) Â Childress indicated Favre wouldn't necessarily get more leeway than anyone else in deciding his status this week and that he wasn't worried about Favre's starting streak.
