    Lebron has announced he will sign with the Miami heat. Now, what does this all mean? Miami has 3 great players on their roster and not much else. If Bosh, LeBron and Wade each take $15 million a year, they will have to fill out their roster with nothing but minimum salary players. If one of them were to get hurt, their season would basically be over. As you can probably tell I don't like this decision, but it's do or die time for LeBron now. He has no excuses. If they don't win a title next year he can't say the second best player on his team in Mo Williams.
