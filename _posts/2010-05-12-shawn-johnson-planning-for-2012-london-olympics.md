    West Des Moines resident Shawn Johnson, a gold medal winner at the 2008 Olympic Games announced Tuesday morning that she will <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2010-05-04-shawn-johnson-london-olympics_N.htm">attempt to make the USA roster</a> for the 2012 London Olympics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Shawn revealed her decision at Hy-Vee Hall in front of nearly 8,000 area students.

  <p>
    &#8220;I got caught up in the moment,&#8221; Johnson later explained. &#8220;And what better way to do it than to inspire 8,000 kids.&#8221;
  </p>

  <p>
    Until today, the 18-year-old Johnson had remained on the fence as to whether or not she would compete in another Olympics. She won four medals — one gold, in the balance beam, and three silvers — in China, but is still recovering from a recent knee injury.

  <p>
    Johnson is best known in her post-Olympic life for winning a championship on the ABC-TV reality show Dancing With The Stars in the spring of 2009 and for occasional acting and promotional appearances around the world.

    &#8220;(There's) something about it that called me back,&#8221; Johnson said of gymnastics. &#8220;I'm a little kid at heart. I can't get away from it and I missed it a lot.&#8221;
