    This is a ridiculous play, Dwyane Wade does a baseball style pass to LeBron James from one end of the court to another, and LeBron oops it in. Â I'm pretty sure I did that in NBA Jam last night, it's a little more amazing in real life.

    Maybe having LeBron and Wade on the same team isn't all that bad.
