    Never thought I would be putting women's NCAA basketball on my site, but hey they have good fundamentals. Brittney Griner (Baylor) was upset with getting fouled by Jordan Barncastle (Texas Tech). So she did what every other upset player does, she punched her in the face. Everyone does that right? Griner was ejected from the game, and my guess is she will get some disciplinary action from Baylor. Man, Women's basketball is intense!
