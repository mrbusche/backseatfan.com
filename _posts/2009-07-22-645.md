    <span>Classic Video of the Detroit Lions Former QB Dan Orlovsky as he runs in to the endzone. For a Safety, not a touchdown. He is now with the Houstan Texans. Hopefully Matt Schaub </span>doesn't get hurt, because your two backups are Dan Orlovsky and Rex Grossman<span>. </span><span> Good Luck Texans!<br /> </span>
