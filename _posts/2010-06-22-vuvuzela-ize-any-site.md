  <p>
    Turn any site into the World Cup.  That's right, just add a URL to the end of <a href="https://www.vuvuzela-time.co.uk/">https://www.vuvuzela-time.co.uk/</a> and feel the atmosphere of the World Cup at your home or work.  For instance "World Cup: Backseat Fan Edition" sounds like this -->  <a href="https://www.vuvuzela-time.co.uk/backseatfan.com ">https://www.vuvuzela-time.co.uk/backseatfan.com </a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Use <a href="https://bit.ly">bit.ly</a> to mess with your friends and co workers.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://bit.ly/a3PKSj">bit.ly/a3PKSj</a> is the link for Backseat Fan, you they won't know what hit them until they click on it and feel the deafening B flat of the Vuvuzela!
