    Chad Jones, a star athlete at LSU in both football and baseball was seriously injured in a car accident early this morning in New Orleans. He suffered a broken left leg and had arteries and nerves exposes when his SUV crashed into a street car pole. Jones is listed in critical condition and had surgery this morning. The doctors were attempting to get blood flow back into his left foot.

    It was not clear what caused Jones to lose control of his Range Rover at about 7 am ET this morning. "My understanding is that he was awake and he actually gave my cell phone to the police officer who was talking to him," Al Jones said. That quote to me is amazing, the guy's leg is torn apart and he's still alert enough to give a cell phone number to the police officer.

    Jones was drafted in the third round this year and was part of LSU's 2007 national championship team. He was also a lefty reliever for the LSU baseball team that won the college world series in 2009. The Milwaukee Brewers drafted him weeks after the Giants took him in the NFL draft. Jones was also drafted by the Houston Astros out of high school.

    Our thoughts and prayers here at BSF go out to Chad Jones and his family, here's to a full recovery.
