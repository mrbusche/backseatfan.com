<div class="entry">
  <ol>
    <li>
      Jimmy Graham - Graham was tagged 'non-exclusively' meaning a team can give up 2 first round picks to sign him. If I were the Packers or Patriots I think I'd strongly consider it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Greg Hardy - signed his tender, but is hoping for a long term deal
    </li>
    <li>
      Brian Orakpo - also signed his tender, but also is hoping for a long term deal
    </li>
    <li>
      Nick Folk - Really good kicker, good decision by the Jets
    </li>
  </ol>
