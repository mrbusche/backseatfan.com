    The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have signed their 9th and final draft pick, Gerald McCoy. McCoy signed his contract this morning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jay Glazer is reporting it's a <a href="http://twitter.com/Jay_Glazer/statuses/20008430896">5 year deal</a> worth up to $63.5 million with $35 million in guarantees.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bucs also drafted another high profile defensive tackle in this year's draft, Brian Price. The Buccaneers are hoping those two can be the anchors of their defensive line for the next decade.

    The emotion that poured out of Gerald McCoy when he was drafted showed the passion this kid has for the game. I don't care what team you root for, his embrace with Roger Goodell in the video below is about as good as it gets. It will be hard not to root for him this year and the rest of his career.
