  <p>
    This is a parody of Usain Bolt's winning race but I can't imaging what's going on in his head is too different than what this video shows.

  <p>
    Bolt - &#8220;It was at this point I realized I was going to win.&#8221;

  <p>
    Announcer - &#8220;But you just started the race.&#8221;
  </p>

  <p>
    Bolt - &#8220;Exactly.&#8221;
