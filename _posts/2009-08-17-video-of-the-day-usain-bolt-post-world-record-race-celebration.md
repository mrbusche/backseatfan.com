<div class="entry">
  <p>
    This is a parody of Usain Bolt's winning race but I can't imaging what's going on in his head is too different than what this video shows.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bolt - "It was at this point I realized I was going to win."
  </p>

  <p>
    Announcer - "But you just started the race."
  </p>

  <p>
    Bolt - "Exactly."
  </p>
