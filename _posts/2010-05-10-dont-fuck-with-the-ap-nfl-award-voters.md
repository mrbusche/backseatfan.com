<div class="entry">
  <p>
    The Associated Press yanked Brian Cushing's Defensive Rookie of the Year Award.  Which they should, since it is tainted.  So he loses last year's award, plus he can't gain any awards or Pro Bowl status because he will be serving his suspension this upcoming year.

    <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5683" title="Brian-Cushing" src="/images/2010/05/Brian-Cushing.png" alt="Brian-Cushing" width="269" height="410" srcset="/images/2010/05/Brian-Cushing.png 269w, /images/2010/05/Brian-Cushing-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" />
  </p>

  <p>
    So now that Cushing's steroid use is known and not just a rumor that everyone knows about, how far will he fall once he is off of his cycle?
