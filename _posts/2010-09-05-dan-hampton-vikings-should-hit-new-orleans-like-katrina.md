<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Hall of Fame Chicago Bears defensive lineman made a questionable comment this morning choosing winners of the Vikings vs Saints game that kicks off the NFL regular season.

    Hampton said, &#8220;If you watched that playoff game last year, the Vikings need to go down and hit that town like Katrina.&#8221; He put some extra emphasis on Katrina so it's hard to believe he was trying to say anything other than the obvious. If Hampton is invited back to next week's show I hope he opens it with an apology.<br />
