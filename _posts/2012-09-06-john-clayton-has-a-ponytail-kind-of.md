    The Mythical John Clayton Ponytail, has anyone ever seen it? How long is it? How does he hide it so well. All these things are answered in the new &#8220;This is Sportcenter - John Clayton&#8221; ESPN commercial.

    OK, so he (probably) doesn't really have a ponytail. But maybe he does, you never see a side view, you only see him from front. Clayton could totally rock the pony and have it go unnoticed. We all wish he did. The Dan Patrick Show always talks about the mythical ponytail, and finally it is real. Kind of.

    Honestly, this might be one of the best ESPN commercials ever.
