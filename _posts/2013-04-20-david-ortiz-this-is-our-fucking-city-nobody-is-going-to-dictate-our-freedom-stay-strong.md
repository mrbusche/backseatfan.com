    It's times like these were many of us turn to sports for a distraction from the chaos going on. David Ortiz was born in the Dominican Republic in 1975. He started his career in 1997 with the Minnesota Twins and honestly wasn't a very good player. In 2003 he went to Boston and that's where he's stayed. It's safe to say David Ortiz loves Boston and Boston loves David Ortiz.

    No baseball fan, let alone a Boston fan will every forget his 2004 playoffs where he hit .400 with a .515 OBP and .764 slugging percentage. His single in game 4 against the Red Sox started the most improbably comeback in baseball history. In game 4 and game 5 Ortiz hit a walk off home run and walk off single that will forever be etched into baseball history.

    I know the SEC will get on Ortiz and NESN for this, but this is what baseball fans needed, this is what America needed. There are times when an F-bomb are appropriate. Ortiz didn't just throw fuck into a regular sentence he added it to a speech that shows what America is all about, a person born in the Dominican Republic that loves the USA and Boston just like they love their home country. Cheers Papi.
