<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Blake Griffin is promoting USC's TE Jordan Cameron for the 2011 NFL Draft. I'm not that impressed with the promotion of Jordan Cameron but I am impressed with Griffin's 1980's Nike clothes. Although I guess it is good to know your future tight end can dunk and might break an ankle playing basketball during the offseason.
