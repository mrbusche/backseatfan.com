      I just came across an article on <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy/blog/roto_arcade/post/Usain-Bolt-would-run-the-40-in-WHAT-?urn=fantasy,184570">Yahoo Sports</a> that calculated Usain Bolts 40 time:
    </p>

    <p>
      Hand Time:  3.73 - This is what NFL uses
    </p>

    <p>
      Electronically Time: 3.97 - This is what Track and Field uses
    </p>

    <p>
      That is just freaking ridiculous.  If Al Davis saw this I think he would crap himself. <span>Darrius Heyward-Bey ran a 4.3 at this years combine and he paid him 38 million. I think that if Usain Bolt entered the draft Al Davis would give us all of his picks to get him. He would pay him 110 Million dollars just to run straight, and occasionally catch the ball. </span>

      <span>Come on Al, pull some strings, get this thing going.</span>
