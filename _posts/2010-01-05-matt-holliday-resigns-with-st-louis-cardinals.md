    Matt Holliday agreed to a 7 year, $120 million contract with the St. Louis Cardinals today.
  </p>

  <p>
    &#8220;The chance to win was always a big point for me,&#8221; Holliday said on the Doug Gottlieb show. He also added &#8220;Albert is the best player in the history of baseball in my mind.&#8221;
  </p>

  <p>
    &#8220;Well, I think first of all going into free agency I had in the back of my mind that I really liked my time in St. Louis and felt it was a good fit for me and my family.&#8221; Hard to believe their is a more diehard baseball town outside of New York.
  </p>

  <p>
    He added: &#8220;At the end of the day we decided that was best for us.&#8221;
  </p>

  <p>
    Holliday, just 29, had 13 HR and 55 RBI in 63 games last year with the Cardinals.
  </p>

  <p>
    It will be interesting to see if the Cardinals will have enough money to resign Albert Pujols when his contract runs out in 2 years.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyone who wants to say, &#8220;that's a lot of money for a guy who can't catch a fly ball.&#8221; Shut your mouth, Holliday is a good defensive outfielder and he won't let that catch define his career.
