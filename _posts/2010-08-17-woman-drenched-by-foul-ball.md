    A woman was enjoying her beer at a Nationals game when a line drive hit her beer bottle. The beer then exploded all over her face. Damn those $10 metal bottles! Look at the bright side, at least she only got hit in the face by the beer and not the ball.

    But notice the guy in the blue striped  shirt.  He total just dodges out of the way.  If those two were dating they would break up for sure.
