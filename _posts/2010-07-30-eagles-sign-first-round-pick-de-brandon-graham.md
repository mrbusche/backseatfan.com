  <p>
    The Philadelphia Eagles have finalized a five-year contract with rookie first-round defensive end Brandon Graham.
  </p>

  <p>
    Graham was the 13th overall pick in the 2010 draft, the former Michigan standout is expected to immediately start on the Eagles defensive line.
  </p>

  <p>
    Financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed. The 13th pick in last year's draft, <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2009/05/2009-nfl-draft-rookie-signing-status/">Brian Orakpo</a>, received a $20million contract with $12.1million guaranteed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Graham has been considered undersized his whole career, he's just 6'1&#8243; with 30 1/2&#8243; arms, 4 or 5 inches smaller than the average at that position.
