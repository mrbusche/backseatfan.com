<div class="entry">
  <p>
    MLB.com has <a href="http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=12404949&topic_id=8877962&c_id=tor">put together a video</a> showing each of Jose Bautista's 54 home runs this season. It's remarkable that his first opposite field home run is his most recent this year.
  </p>

  <p>
    There has been a lot of speculation about Jose Bautista being on steroids, but how can anyone say that? I'm sure he's being tested as frequently as Alex Rodriguez and he's done for this past 200 games now.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, it's not like he's hitting deep shots all over the field, he has just one opposite field home run this year, which I think proves he's just figured out how to pull the ball.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't think he should win it, but I think Bautista should receive some votes for AL MVP, without him the Blue Jays would not be finishing the season 8 games over .500.

    If you're not sure if you should like Jose, check out the video below, Bautista is a real team guy and just happy to be playing in the major leagues.
