    It is said that there is no more loyal and passionate of a supporter than a football fan. Football fans all over the world agree to this fact. Their interest, as a group, stems back from several reasons, ranging from the past history of their club, which also includes the ground itself, the players of the game, the managers of their favorite teams, going all the way to the awards and the trophies won by their respective clubs and organizations. Because of this, a typical football fan gathers different collector&rsquo;s items, keeping them as memoir of their favorite team.
