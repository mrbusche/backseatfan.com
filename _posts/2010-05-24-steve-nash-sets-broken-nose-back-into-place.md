    Steve Nash is one tough dude. Nash took a headbutt to the nose from Derek Fisher, broke it, then set it back into place like it was nothing.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "I was trying to move it while it was still fresh," Nash said. "I know that once it sets it's harder."
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Nash practiced earlier today, and then left to have surgery to set his broken nose. He said he should have no problem playing on Tuesday.

  <p>
    Grant Hill looked like he had more pain from the nose break than Steve Nash.

    Steve Nash can take some hits, he took the elbow to the eye last series, and now he broke his nose. What's next, A punch to the jaw from Ron Artest?
  </p>

  <p>
    Steve Nash is from Canada, so he is he must have some of that hockey toughness in him.
