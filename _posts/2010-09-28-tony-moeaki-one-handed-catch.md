    This is an amazing catch by Kansas City Chiefs tight end Tony Moeaki.  This former Iowa Tight End could have been a first rounder if he was healthy all through college.

    Moeaki is for real, I hate to call him the new Tony Gonzalez, but he will be.  If he can stay healthy, he will be one of the greatest pass catching tight ends out there.  As you can see from the video above, he has skills.

    So are the Chiefs for real?  They are an exciting team.  They have weapons, they have trick plays, but can they keep this up all season?
