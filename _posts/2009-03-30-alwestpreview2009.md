    1. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-75" title="bracket" src="/images/2009/03/laa.gif" alt="LAAngels" /> Los Angeles Angels - New closer Brian Fuentes is not much of a downgrade from K-Rod in actuality. Fuentes converted on 88.2% of his save opportunities while Rodriguez converted on 89.9%. The addition of Bobby Abreu in LF should make up for the loss in productivity of Vlad Guerrero being a year older. The Angels won't run away with it, but they'll win the division, expect 85-88 wins.<br /> 2. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-75" title="bracket" src="/images/2009/03/oak.gif" alt="Athletics" /> Oakland Athletics - The A's stepped it up this off season, acquiring 1B Jason Giambi, LF Matt Holliday and SS Orlando Cabrera. Brett Anderson and Trevor Cahill have been great thus far in the spring with the injury to Justin Duchscherer they both may find spots in the majors on opening day. The A's will be in the race all season but I think the uncertainty with Joey Devine at closer cost them the 2 games the finish behind, expect 83-86 wins<br /> 3. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-75" title="bracket" src="/images/2009/03/sea.gif" alt="Mariners" /> Seattle Mariners - On the bright side the Mariners can't get any worse then last season when they lost 101 games. Brandon Morrow has seemingly locked down the closer role but has had injury concerns all spring training. Ken Griffey, Jr coming back will provide a feel good story but the Mariners won't be much better than last year, expect 70-73 wins.<br /> 4. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-75" title="bracket" src="/images/2009/03/tex.gif" alt="Rangers" /> Texas Rangers - The offense will not struggle to produce runs but the pitching staff will struggle as it has in years past. Michael Young has taken the team first approach moving his gold glove defense from SS to 3B to make room for 20 year old phenom Elvis Andrus. The Ranger will struggle again this year, I expect no more than 68 wins.
