<div class="entry">
  <p>
    The University of Alabama's national championship football trophy will be on display at Walmart in Tuscaloosa on Saturday and another Walmart store in Gardendale on Sunday.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fans will be able to get their picture taken with the actual Coaches' Trophy that was presented after the BCS win over Texas.
  </p>

  <p>
    The $30,000 trophy will be permanently displayed on campus.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before you start making a ton of Alabama / Walmart jokes the trophy is on display there because of part of a sponsorship deal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe next year they should try sponsoring with a better company. Target maybe?
