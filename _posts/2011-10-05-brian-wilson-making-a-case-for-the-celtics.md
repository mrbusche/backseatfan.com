    Brian Wilson may be a little crazy (or a little genius), but he is making a pretty good case for the Boston Celtics as the greatest team of all time.

    Join the debat on <a title="https://www.NBA2KDebate.com" dir="ltr" href="https://www.nba2kdebate.com/" target="_blank">https://www.NBA2KDebate.com</a>, my vote goes for the Bulls.

    By the way I am pretty excited for NBA2k12, no need to have a season, I can just play it on PS3 and maybe then the Suns will win the title.
