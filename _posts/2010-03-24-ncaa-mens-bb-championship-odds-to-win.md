    Here are the Odds to win the NCAA Championship from the remaining Sweet 16 teams:
  </p>

  <p>
    Kentucky: 2-1<br /> Syracuse: 7-2<br /> Duke: 6-1<br /> West Virginia: 6-1<br /> Kansas State: 8-1<br /> Ohio State: 8-1<br /> Baylor: 20-1<br /> Michigan State: 25-1<br /> Tennessee: 25-1<br /> Washington: 30-1<br /> Butler: 35-1<br /> Xavier: 35-1<br /> Northern Iowa: 40-1<br /> Purdue: 40-1<br /> Saint Mary's: 40-1<br /> Cornell: 60-1
