    Zach Randolph has played for four teams in nine years, but actually started playing well for the Grizzlies this season. He played hard and was actually a model citizen in Memphis this season.
  </p>

  <p>
    But like they say, you can't teach an old dog how to not get in trouble with the law.Â <a href="https://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=AlXaRReO1e7eDILgfR9Sb5zYrYZ4/SIG=11s8m6bji/**http%3A//www.theindychannel.com/news/23686810/detail.html">According to Indianapolis 6News' Jack Rinehart</a>, Randolph's latest misstep might be a big one.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      According to a probable cause affidavit, a trusted police informant identified Memphis Grizzlie player Zach Randolph as a major marijuana supplier in Indianapolis, 6News' Jack Rinehart reported.
    </p>

    <p>
      Narcotics officers were staking out a suspected drug house on Indianapolis' north side two weeks ago when they pulled over Arthur Boyd, 32, soon after he left the residence, near 75th Street and Binford Avenue, police said.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the affidavit, the Cadillac Escalade that Boyd was driving was registered to Randolph, and police found marijuana and ammunition stowed inside.
    </p>

    I don't see how anything good can possibly come out of this, except it gives us an excuse to bring back this video of the greatest airball in NBA history.
