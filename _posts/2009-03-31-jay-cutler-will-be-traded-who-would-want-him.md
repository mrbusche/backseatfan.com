    In a stunning turn of events, Broncos owner Pat Bowlen released a statement at 8 p.m. Central time Tuesday saying both he and coach Josh McDaniels had been unable to get Cutler to call them back over the last 10 days.

    The Jets, Bucaneers, and Lions are the most obvious destinations for Cutler but do any of them <em>really</em> want him? He's 17-20 as a starter and he's acting like he's just led the Broncos to back to back Super Bowls. As a Vikings fan, when news first broke that Jay Cutler wanted to be traded I wanted him on the Vikings, even if it cost a 1st round and a 3rd round pick. Now, I don't want him coming anywhere near Minneapolis. Jay Cutler is a baby, at this point he's almost as bad as Terrell Owens.

    Return a phone call Jay, quit being a bitch, 17-20 as a starter doesn't qualify you as great much less untradeable. The only reason you made the Pro Bowl this season is because none of the QBs in the AFC wanted to go this year. You're a good quarterback and you will probably be a franchise quarterback for many years to come, but no one is going to want you on their team if you're going to keep being a diva and crying about how these events have transpired.

    What do you guys think? Is Jay Cutler being a bitch or is his attitude justifed?
