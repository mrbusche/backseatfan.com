        Not much change at the top this week, but we do have a shakeup in the bottom 10.
      </p>

      <p>
        1. Indianapolis colts (5-2) - I'm convinced Peyton could be given guys off of practice squads at all the skill positions and with a week of practice he'd still win.
      </p>

      <p>
        2. Pittsburgh Steelers (5-2) - Yep, they lost, but they're still the 2nd best team in the league.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. Baltimore Ravens (5-2) - Big game this week against a Miami team that is really good on the road.
      </p>

      <p>
        4. New York Giants (5-2) - Bye week came at a perfect time for them, but now they travel to Seattle who is a good home team
      </p>

      <p>
        5. New England Patriots (6-1) - They're 6-1 and have the best record in the league, but they're not the best team.
      </p>

      <p>
        6. New York Jets (5-2) - What a pitiful offensive performance. Where is Shonn Greene?
      </p>

      <p>
        7. Atlanta Falcons (5-2) - Tampa Bay comes to town for a battle for 5-2 teams. Who would have thought that?
      </p>

      <p>
        8. Kansas City Chiefs (5-2) - They struggled against the Bills, but they got the win. That's all that matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        9. Green Bay Packers (5-3) - Another big win for this team. I have to start buying in a little.
      </p>

      <p>
        10. Miami Dolphins (4-3) - When your kicker has 10 field goals in 2 games, something's not right.
      </p>

      <p>
        11. Philadelphia Eagles (4-3) - Michael Vick is back and so is Desean Jackson (looks like it at least) can they take down the mighty Colts?
      </p>

      <p>
        12. Tennessee Titans (5-3) - Perfect time for a bye for this team coming off a loss and gaining Randy Moss.
      </p>

      <p>
        13. New Orleans Saints (5-3) - The Saints really need to find a run game.
      </p>

      <p>
        14. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-2) - If they win at Atlanta this week, they might just be the best team in the NFC.
      </p>

      <p>
        15. St. Louis Rams (4-4) - Is there anyone tougher than Steven Jackson? He's always hurt, but plays every week. It's amazing.
      </p>

      <p>
        16. San Diego Chargers (3-5) - Philip Rivers threw for 305 yards with no WR's. He's pretty good, but I'm not convinced on the Chargers
      </p>

      <p>
        17. Oakland Raiders (4-4) - These are the Raiders I believed in with my preseason predictions
      </p>

      <p>
        18. Washington Redskins (4-4) - Mike Shanahan thought Rex Grossman gave them a better chance to win than McNabb? Yikes.
      </p>

      <p>
        19. Houston Texans (4-3) - Every week I change my opinion of this team, so I'm going to say it. I have no idea where to rank these guys.
      </p>

      <p>
        20. Minnesota Vikings (2-5) - If they can't beat the Cardinals this week. They might as well pack it in like the Cowboys did.
      </p>

      <p>
        21. Cincinnati Bengals (2-5) - He's not the only problem, but where is the 2009 Cedric Benson?
      </p>

      <p>
        22. Chicago Bears (4-3) - Playing at Buffalo this week will not be good for this team.
      </p>

      <p>
        23. Arizona Cardinals (3-34 - Their QB situation is brutal and Beanie Wells is hurt not much else to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        24. Seattle Seahawks (4-3) - This team is really bad away from home.
      </p>

      <p>
        25. Denver Broncos (2-5) - Kyle Orton isn't the problem in Denver, yet they still might bench him for Tebow?
      </p>

      <p>
        26. Cleveland Browns (2-5) - They will put up a fight against New England this week.
      </p>

      <p>
        27. Detroit Lions (1-5) - Ndamukong Suh could make the Pro Bowl this year. He's a beast.
      </p>

      <p>
        28. Jacksonville Jaguars (4-4) - They beat the worst team in the league last week, something they had to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        29. San Francisco 49ers (2-6) - There's a reason Troy Smith was the starter ahead of Joe Flacco in 2008 (before he got sick).
      </p>

      <p>
        30. Buffalo Bills (0-7) - This team isn't very good, but they play hard every week.
      </p>

      <p>
        31. Carolina Panthers (1-6) - What has happened to Deangelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart?
      </p>

      <p>
        32. Dallas Cowboys (1-6) - The Cowboys could realistically lose every game the rest of the season. They are horrific.
