    Seeing the Tim Tebow crying cover on the front of <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2010/07/ncaa-football-11-cover-of-tim-tebow-crying/">NCAA Football 2011</a> reminded me of this local story back around Christmas time. A family, Ed and Schelly Odeen arrived at their home after attending the Orange Bowl in Miami and heard the faint cry of an unfamiliar visitor, it was a cat that had crawled in the small space between the spare tire and underneath the bed of the truck.

  <p>
    The family named the cat &#8220;Tebow&#8221;, but not because the cat attends church every Sunday. &#8220;We named her Tebow because she's a crier,&#8221; said their 19 year old daughter Becki.
