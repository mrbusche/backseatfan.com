    The Big Lebowski is a cult classic, a great movie, any time it is on tv you have to sit down and watch it. Dirk Nowitzki is a big fan, and why not do a spoof on it? But my only question is, why didn't he do this sooner?!?! Lebowski, Nowitzki, it's a match made in heaven. Not sure if any other NBA / NFL star could have a closer name comparison to Lebowski.
