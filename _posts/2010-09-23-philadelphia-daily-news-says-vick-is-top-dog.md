    I saw this the other day, and just didn't have time time to post it.  I don't think it is that clever for them to say that he is Top Dog, I think might be a little too soon, and probably shouldn't have been on a newspaper.  So when he has a terrible game will they make puns about getting rid of the dog?  Probably.  Stay Classy Philly News.
