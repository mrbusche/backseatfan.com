    Buster Posey, MLB.com's number 4 prospect, is expected to be called up today to help the Giants' struggling offense. Posey played seven games with the Giants in 2009 going 2-17 with the only 2 hits being singles, but this spring Posey batted .315 in 24 exhibition games. Posey was the 5th overall pick in the 2008 MLB Draft.

    Posey was drafted as a catcher and is most valuable to the Giants at the position in the long term, but he is expected to play first base, leaving Bengie Molina at catcher because he is a superb handler of the pitching staff. Aubrey Huff, who is the Giants current first basemen, announced last week that he would gladly move to the OF if it meant calling up Buster Posey to play first. Huff will likely play LF.

    Posey's fantasy value this season is up in the air, if you are in a keeper league he must be owned and I would assume he is in 99% of keeper leagues. In a 12 team or deeper league you want him, but unless you're really struggling at catcher in a 10 team league, I don't think he should be added at this point.
