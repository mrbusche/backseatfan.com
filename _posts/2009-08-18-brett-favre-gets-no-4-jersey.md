  <p>
    John David Booty gave up his No. 4 Jersey to Brett Favre. There is no surprise here I am sure it was some sort of stipulation in Favre's Contract. There is no way that Favre would have picked a different number, or joined the team as anything but No. 4. I would like to see what Booty got for giving up his jersey number. John David Booty will now wear the No. 9 Jersey. Sorry to everyone who already has a Booty jersey, maybe you can get a partial refund. Not really sure what I am going to do with mine, maybe it will be a collectors item.
