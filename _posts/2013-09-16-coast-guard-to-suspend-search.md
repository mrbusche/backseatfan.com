    There are many people in the world who jump on their bicycle to go to school or to go to their workplaces. In some Countries it&rsquo;s even normal to see people <a href="https://www.ibike.org/encouragement/benefits.htm">riding a bicycle</a> instead of driving a car. We are talking of places such as Holland, Stockholm and UK, so this means that not only poor people choose to go by bicycle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Actually choosing the bicycle as a non polluting mean of transportation doesn&rsquo;t means that one can&rsquo;t afford a car. On the other side, it means that one chooses the most modern and polite way to reach places.

  <h2>
    Advantages of going by bicycle every day
  </h2>

  <p>
    Of course, there are many advantages that we could list here, but we want to limit to just a few very important ones. First off, going by bicycle increases your mobility and in some cases you can be faster. Think about a simple but also very common situation: someone invited you to go to play to a lottery house. This is not too far, so you decide to go by bicycle. During the way, you see a terrible traffic jam with hundreds cars practically stopped in the street. Well, we are pretty sure that in such a moment you will thank yourself for having chosen to take your bicycle!
  </p>

  <p>
    So you can finally reach your lottery house on time to play with your friends.
  </p>

  <p>
    A bicycle can put a happy end to your daily appointments.

  <h2>
    With or without?
  </h2>

  <p>
    So, you can see now how helpful a bicycle can be. But of course, when outside it&rsquo;s rainy or too windy it would be dangerous to go out with your bicycle. So, the chances here are two: either you take a bus or you stay at home.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have to stay at home, don&rsquo;t desperate because you can still play all the lottery games you wish to play! You could think to visit <a href="https://www.lotteryplanet.org">https://www.lotteryplanet.org</a> and to start to play there your luckiest numbers.
