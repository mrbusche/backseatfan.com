    Every now and then we will post some old school NFL clips, because they are pretty damn sweet to watch.

    <strong>Gale Sayers</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Gale Sayers was a Chicago Bears Running back from 1965 to 1971. His career was cut short by injury, but he made his name known in his brief NFL career.

  <p>
    Sayers' records include most touchdowns in a rookie season with 22, and he also is tied with most touchdowns in a game with 6. He was also a deadly kick returner, and ties the record with many players for most kick returns in a game with 2.

  <p>
    Sayers was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977, and is still the youngest inductee in the Hall's history.
