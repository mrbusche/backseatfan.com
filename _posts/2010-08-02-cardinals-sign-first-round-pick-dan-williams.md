  <p>
    The <a href="https://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5429724">Arizona Cardinals have agreed to terms</a> with their first round draft pick Dan Williams.  The 26th overall pick out of Tennessee should sign the contract Monday when he gets into camp.
  </p>

  <p>
    Contract Details have not been released yet for this five year deal.

    Dan Williams was the last pick for the Cardinals to sign. They started camp on Friday so he has a little bit to catch up on. He should make a good impact this year since Bertrand Berry retired during the offseason.
