  <p>
    The St Louis Rams have signed first overall pick Sam Bradford to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Adam_Schefter/statuses/19956060873">6 year $78 million deal</a> that includes $50 million guaranteed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bradford received $6 million more in overall money than last year's #1 overall pick Matthew Stafford and $8.3 million more in guaranteed money.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bradford missed most of the 2009 college football season with a shoulder injury but threw for 4,720 yards in 2008 with 50 TDs, that team lost to #2 Florida in the National Championship game. In 2007 Bradford threw for 3121 yards and 36 TDs for a team that lost to West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl.

  <p>
    It's hard to imagine tempered expectations for the 22 year old. Who is now one of the highest paid players in football.
