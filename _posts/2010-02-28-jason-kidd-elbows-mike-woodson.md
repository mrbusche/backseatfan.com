<div class="entry">
  <p>
    <br /> Jason Kidd Elbows Mike Woodson for being on the court. Kidd drew a technical for this, because Woodson was on the court. Maybe he shouldn't have thrown an elbow, maybe fake fall, which could have started a really great brawl. And sweet news headlines "Coach attacks Kidd" , "Coach Trips Kidd during game".
