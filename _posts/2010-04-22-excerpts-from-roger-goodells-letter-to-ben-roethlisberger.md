    Ben Roethlisberger was suspended for at least 6 weeks, and he can have his suspension decreased to 4 weeks with good behavior. Chances are he will probably only server a 4 weeks suspension. He also has to undergo Psychiatric therapy, for his troubles. And Bonus, he is probably on the trading block. It has been said that the Steelers have been shopping him around. Is it worth it to have Big Ben for a first rounder? Yes. Even though he is a Douchebag, he is good at football, and would definitely be worth trading any first round pick for him.

    I looked everywhere to find the full letter but the best I could find is excerpts from Goodell’s letter, but you get the idea:
  </p>

  <p>
    “The personal conduct policy makes clear that I may impose discipline ‘even where the conduct does not result in conviction of a crime’ as, for example, where the conduct ‘imposes inherent danger to the safety and well being of another person’,” Goodell stated in his letter to Roethlisberger. “As the District Attorney concluded, the extensive investigatory record shows that you contributed to the irresponsible consumption of alcohol by purchasing (or facilitating the purchase of) alcoholic beverages for underage college students, at least some of whom were likely already intoxicated. There is no question that the excessive consumption of alcohol that evening put the students and yourself at risk. The personal-conduct policy also states that discipline is appropriate for conduct that ‘undermines or puts at risk the integrity and reputation of the NFL, NFL clubs, or NFL players.’ By any measure, your conduct satisfies that standard.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I recognize that the allegations in Georgia were disputed and that they did not result in criminal charges being filed against you. My decision today is not based on a finding that you violated Georgia law, or on a conclusion that differs from that of the local prosecutor. That said, you are held to a higher standard as an NFL player, and there is nothing about your conduct in Milledgeville that can remotely be described as admirable, responsible, or consistent with either the values of the league or the expectations of our fans.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Your conduct raises sufficient concerns that I believe effective intervention now is the best step for your personal and professional welfare.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I believe it is essential that you take full advantage of the resources available to you. My ultimate disposition in this matter will be influenced by the extent to which you do so, what you learn as a result, and a demonstrated commitment to making positive change in your life.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “In your six years in the NFL, you have first thrilled and now disappointed a great many people. I urge you to take full advantage of this opportunity to get your life and career back on track.”
