  <p>
    Legendary Cubs player and announcer Ron Santo died Thursday at his home in Arizona.
  </p>

  <p>
    Santo was the Cubs third basemen from 1960-1973 before playing his final year with the White Sox in 1974. He became a Cubs broadcaster in 1990 and never apologized for cheering for his team or being frustrated when the team messed up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Santo batted .277 in his major league career with 342 home runs and 1331 RBIs, it was his longtime goal to be elected into the baseball hall of fame and now, if he is elected, will not be there to accept the award.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Santo was 18 he was diagnosed with diabetes, a disease he would later lose by legs to. WGN was first to break the news of Santo's passing from complications of bladder cancer.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the era of free agency it's hard to find a guy like Santo who lives and dies one team his entire life, he will be solely missed by his family, friends, the Cubs' family and all of baseball.
