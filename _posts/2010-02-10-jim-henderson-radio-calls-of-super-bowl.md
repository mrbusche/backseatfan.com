    Jim Henderson Radio Call on Saints vs Colts Super Bowl
  </p>

  <p>
    The best call is the Porter interception at about 2:40 in. I still love the response from the<a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2010/01/paul-allen-radio-call-of-brett-favre-interception-in-4th-quarter/">Viking's Paul Allen on Favres Interception</a> the best. But thats just me. Still a good call though.
