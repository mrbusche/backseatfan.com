    Carlos Boozer is the latest NBA free agent to find a new home, agreeing to a five year deal with the Chicago Bulls according to ESPN The Magazine's Ric Bucher. The contract will be worth between $75 and $80 million, although an official announcement cannot come until 12:01 AM ET Thursday morning.

    Boozer has averaged 17.2 points and 10.2 rebounds over his career, posting a 19.5-11.2 average last season. Pairing Boozer with Joakim Noah in the frontcourt and All-Star PG Derrick Rose should make the Bulls contenders in the East. If the Bulls are unable to land LeBron they could try to sign a veteran like Ray Allen, Mike Miller or even Kyle Korver.
