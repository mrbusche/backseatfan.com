    George Steinbrenner was always depicted on Seinfeld, I think it helped make him an icon among people who weren't baseball fans. Â  So I found of some of the best moments, including this cameo of George when he actually came on the show.

    <strong>Jay Buhner<br /> </strong> I couldn't embed this last one, it is the one where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUwSxqnRW-8">Steinbrenner thinks George Costanza is dead</a>, and goes to his parents house. And Mr. Costanza yells at Steinbrenner about Jay Buhner. Classic.
