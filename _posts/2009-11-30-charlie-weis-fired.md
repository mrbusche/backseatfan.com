  <p>
    The Notre Dame Fighting Irish fired Head Football Coach Charilie Weis today. After going 6-2 in the first half of the season, a 4 game skid lost him his job. Or maybe it was the horrible overall record for Weis. His record is worse than Tyrone Willingham and Bob Davie. Both who were fired. Notre Dame is looking for their fifth coach this decade. Which is just ridiculous.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe it was his bad coaching, maybe it was cockiness, maybe it was his large stomach. I don't think boosters really liked him, and personally as a non Notre Dame fan, I didn't like him either.
  </p>

  <p>
    Weis will probably get a coordinator job somewhere in the NFL. The Browns like to hire former Patriot coordinators, he could probably snag a job there.
  </p>

  <p>
    But who will replace Charlie Weis?
  </p>

  <h3>
    Top Candidates:

  <p>
    <strong>Florida - Urban Meyer</strong> - Says he doesn't want the job, but we all know he does.
  </p>

    <strong>Oklahoma - Bob Stoops </strong>- Says he is staying with Oklahoma, but he could use a career change
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="/images/2009/11/Brian_Kelly.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2808" title="brian kelly" src="/images/2009/11/Brian_Kelly.jpg" alt="brian kelly" width="220" height="286" srcset="/images/2009/11/Brian_Kelly.jpg 393w, /images/2009/11/Brian_Kelly-230x300.jpg 230w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" /></a>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Cincinnati - Brian Kelly</strong> - Definitely an upgrade for him.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="/images/2009/11/jim-harbaugh.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2810" title="SPORT NCAA FOOTBALL" src="/images/2009/11/jim-harbaugh.jpg" alt="SPORT NCAA FOOTBALL" width="385" height="282" srcset="/images/2009/11/jim-harbaugh.jpg 550w, /images/2009/11/jim-harbaugh-300x219.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" /></a>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Stanford - Jim Harbaugh </strong>- Turned around the Standford Program, but can he turn around ND?
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="/images/2009/11/patterson.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2812" title="patterson" src="/images/2009/11/patterson.jpg" alt="patterson" width="300" height="200" /></a>

  <p>
    <strong>TCU - Gary Patterson </strong>- I'm sure he would love to get the respect he deserves
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="/images/2009/11/jon_gruden.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2809" title="jon_gruden" src="/images/2009/11/jon_gruden.jpg" alt="jon_gruden" width="401" height="252" srcset="/images/2009/11/jon_gruden.jpg 445w, /images/2009/11/jon_gruden-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /></a>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Jon Gruden</strong> - Always wanted to coach for Notre Dame, although I think he just signed an extension with ESPN though.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="/images/2009/11/dungy1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2811" title="dungy1" src="/images/2009/11/dungy1.jpg" alt="dungy1" width="406" height="228" srcset="/images/2009/11/dungy1.jpg 580w, /images/2009/11/dungy1-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px" /></a>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Tony Dungy </strong>- Probably not interested, but he is good at mentoring. Used to coach for some team in Indiana.
  </p>

  <p>
    My top choice would be Bob Stoops. Maybe he can get Notre Dame into the Big Ten.
