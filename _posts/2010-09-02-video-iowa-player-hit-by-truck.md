  <p>
    Iowa Hawkeyes' center Josh Koeppel was hit by a truck at an intersection in Iowa City while riding his Yamaha motorcycle.  He did a flip and got right up to his feet.   Luckily Iowa speed zones are slow, and he was probably only going about 25 MPH. If it was anymore than that I would expect a bit more carnage.  Koeppel was lucky he didn't get seriously hurt, next time maybe he should consider wearing a helmet.
