    "Jim Johnson has passed away, the team just announced it."
  </p>

  <p>
    From<a href="https://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/browser.asp">the official Eagles press release</a>
  </p>

  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
    "The Philadelphia Eagles are saddened to announce Jim Johnson has passed awayTuesday afternoon at the age of 68 after a courageous battle with cancer.
  </p>

  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
    A veteran of 22 years as an NFL assistant, Johnson is regarded as one of the top defensive masterminds in National Football League history. Over the last decade, he gained a great deal ofpraise as the orchestrator of the renowned Eagles defense. His aggressive style kept Philadelphia at or near the top of the NFL in nearly every major defensive category since joining Andy Reid's staff on January 22, 1999.
  </p>

  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
    Johnson is survived by his wife, Vicky, two children, Scott and Michelle, and four grandchildren, Katie, Justin, Brandon, and Jax."
  </p>

  <p>
    Johnson was diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer in his spine in January.
  </p>

  <p>
    The prognosis was originally good for the 67 year old and he intended to coach this season but over the past week his health severely deteriorated until his passing today.
  </p>

  <p>
    Johnson was known as a well likeable guy who rarely shied away from any question from the media.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Eagles will be playing with heavy hearts this season but if anything I expect them to have an <a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2009/07/2009-nfl-season-preview/">even better season</a> because of this. If you ask any player on the Eagles who they respect the most on the team I bet 75% would say without hesitation, Jim Johnson.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philadelphia and the NFL have not only lost a great coach, they have lost a great man.RIP Jim.
