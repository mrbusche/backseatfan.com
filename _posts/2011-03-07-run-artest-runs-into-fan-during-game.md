    LA Lakers' Ron Artest runs into a fan during a game while trying to get the ball. Not a big deal right? It happens almost every game where a player dives into a crowd. But this fan was attempting to sit or stand and had a drink in his hand. His coffee or soda just goes all over the place when Artest smashes up against him. Watch all of it, because it looks pretty awesome in slow-mo.
