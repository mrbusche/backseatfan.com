    Danny Ainge threw a towel in the air during Hickson's 2nd free throw attempt to try to distract him. Ainge is the President of Operations for the Boston Celtics. Does Mark Cuban have thunder sticks when he sits court-side? Because I feel like this would be in the same category.

    Since then Danny Ainge has apologized and the NBA has fined him<span><span><span> $25,000 for creating an unauthorized distraction.<br /> </span></span></span>
