    <strong>Lyrics</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    It's Thanksgiving Day and Romo will play,<br /> padding his stats the old fashioned way<br /> Beating up on bad teams all day.<br /> He's great against the Seahawks,<br /> He's Unitas versus the Chiefs<br /> and when the Raiders come to town tomorrow,<br /> he'll strap on those touchdown cleats,<br /> He's gonna play great, TDs all day<br /> Then December's here, he'll fumble it away<br /> Romo Claus is coming to town
