    Colorado Rockies catcher Miguel Olivo may be one of the toughest and <em>craziest</em> players in baseball. Earlier this week Olivo stepped out of the dugout in the 8th inning and passed a kidney stone, he then put his catcher gear back on and continued to play the game.

    Now I've never had a kidney and I hope to God I never do, but if I do I doubt I'm going to go out and play baseball after I pass it.

    "Believe me, it's not fun," Olivo said. "Sometimes, when I've got that thing, I just want to die. But I can handle pain a little bit. Once it's gone, I'm normal, I'm good. Let's play baseball."
