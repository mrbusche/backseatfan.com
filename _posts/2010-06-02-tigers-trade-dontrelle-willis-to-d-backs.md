  <p>
    The Detroit Tigers traded left-hander Dontrelle Willis to the Arizona Diamondbacks for right-hander Billy Buckner. Willis is making 12 million per year, but the Tigers are still going to be paying a large portion of Willis' salary.

    Willis is actually a solid hitting pitcher, so he could get a fresh start with the D-backs. The D-backs have had a horrible bullpen all year, and they could use a fresh face as well.

    Hopefully Willis can figure things out, I wouldn't mind heading to downtown to see him pitch. I love his weird throwing motion.
