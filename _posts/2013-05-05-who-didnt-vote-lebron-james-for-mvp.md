    UPDATE - Turns out the Boston Globe's <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2013/05/05/yes-voted-carmelo-anthony-for-mvp-and-for-good-reason/Yo08ZgzGaxzlt9KF0JDfqM/story.html">Gary Washburn was the sole vote</a> for Carmelo for MVP. After reading his article I can't disagree with is logic. As long as it's Most Valuable Player and not Most Outstanding Player it will be open to interpretation and although I don't agree with his vote he's at least man enough to explain why he voted how he did and that's good enough for me

    ORIGINAL STORY - It was Dan LeBatard, now can we quit talking about him? He did it for attention and this is exactly what everyone is giving him. Don't watch his awful show on ESPN. Don't follow him on twitter and don't read his blogs. Even if <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNSteinLine/status/331215439889833985">he doesn't have an MVP like Marc Stein claims</a>. He's at minimum a troll.
