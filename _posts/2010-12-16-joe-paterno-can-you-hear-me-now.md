    A Radio Interview with Joe Paterno didn't go so good. Joe Paterno couldn't complete the interview because he couldn't hear anything. He must not of had his hearing aid turned on, or maybe he had bad reception. Let's face it, no excuses, he is old and just can't hear that well.

    The music in between is annoying, so skip through it. If I had the ambition and the time I would cut the music out and do cut in of the Verizon guy / Joe Paterno. So if anyone wants to do that send me a link!
