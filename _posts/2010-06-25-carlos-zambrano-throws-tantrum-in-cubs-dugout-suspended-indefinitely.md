    Chicago Cubs P Carlos Zambrano threw a tantrum in the dugout this afternoon after surrendering 4 runs in the first inning to the Chicago White Sox. Cubs Manager Lou Piniella sent the starter home after his tirade and Cubs General Manager Jim Hendry later announced he would be suspended indefinitely.

    If you ask me his actions are an embarrassment. The Cubs played a 13 inning game the night before and he basically quits after one inning? If he wasn't such a talented player I think the Cubs would cut him. Check out a video of the tirade below.
