    Former Detroit Red Wing and Hall of Famer Stever Yzerman has been named the new general manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Yzerman had been with the Detroit Red Wings his entire career, he was formerly a captain and most recently the vice president of the NHL team.

    After missing the playoffs for the third straight season Tampa Bay fired general manager, Brian Lawton and coach Rick Tocchet. Earlier this month after Detroit was bounced from the playoffs Yzerman said he would love the opportunity to run his own team and with Ken Holland and Jim Nill expected to sign long term deals with the Red Wings his opportunity would be long awaited in Detroit.
