    Who is their second starter? CC Sabathia is a monster when it comes to pitching in August and September, he is the clear #1 starter for the Yankees, but who is their 2nd starter in the playoffs? Here are the candidates:
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">
    - AJ Burnett He's a coin flip in most starts but against Boston this year he's 0-2 with a 8.50 ERA, against the Angels 1-0 with a 4.26 ERA. That won't cut it pitching against Jon Lester or any of the Angels starters
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">
    - Andy Pettite He's been great this year when healthy, but that has really only been April and August. He had a 4.70 ERA in October, he's 2-1 with a 3.75 ERA against Boston this year and 0-2 7.88 ERA against the Angels, that also won't get it done.
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">
    - Joba Chamberlain I've never felt sorrier for one player. The Yankees are completely destroying his career (he's not helping himself either though) A 4.91 ERA against Boston and 5.40 vs the Angels. Not only has been awful against those two teams he's been awful all season. He's a head case, the Yankees have him thinking, 'geez I'm at 47 pitches already I better get this guy out.' No one can pitch under that kind of pressure. His nearly 2 WHIP against Boston is awful as well.

  <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">
    - Chad Gaudin He may be the best option but he got blown up in his 2 starts against Boston this year (although he was pitching for SD at the time)

    Until the Yankees find a 2nd starter they won't be winning a World Series or making it to the World Series.

    They don't have a quality second starting pitcher. Who is their second starter? CC Sabathia is a monster when it comes to pitching in August and September, he is the clear #1 starter for the Yankees, but who is their 2nd starter in the playoffs?
  </p>

  <p>
    Lets review the candidates:
  </p>

  <p>
    - AJ Burnett - He's a coin flip in most starts but against Boston this year he's 0-2 with a 8.50 ERA and has a 4.26 ERA against the Angels although he is 1-0. That won't cut it pitching against Josh Beckett, Jon Lester or any of the Angels starters.
  </p>

  <p>
    - Andy Pettite - He's been great this year when healthy, but that has really only been April and August. He had a 4.70 ERA in September, he is 2-1 with a 3.75 ERA against Boston this year but 0-2 with 7.88 ERA against the Angels, that also won't get it done.
  </p>

  <p>
    - Joba Chamberlain - I've never felt sorrier for one player. The Yankees are completely destroying his career (he's not helping himself either though) A 4.91 ERA against Boston and 5.40 vs the Angels. Not only has been awful against those two teams he's been awful all season. He's a head case, the Yankees have him thinking, 'geez I'm at 47 pitches already I better get this guy out.' No one can pitch under that kind of pressure. If he qualified for the WHIP title his 1.56 WHIP would be the worst of all starters.

    - Chad Gaudin He may actually be their best option but he got blown up in his 2 starts against the Angels this year (although he was pitching for SD at the time). Not to mention pitching in San Diego in July is a lot different than pitching in New York in October
