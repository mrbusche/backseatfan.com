    This sort of ruined my upset special, so I have to point out how close I am to being a genius. If Stevie Johnson catches the ball they win the game, if he drops it they lose. Plain and simple, it was the game winning drop.

    But give Steve Johnson some credit, he is doing awesome this year and shouldn't be so hard on <a href="http://twitter.com/StevieJohnson13/status/9006757670031360">himself/God</a>. Stevie should just catch with his hands and not his chest. Not blame God for not helping him catch the ball. Has God ever helped the Bills?
