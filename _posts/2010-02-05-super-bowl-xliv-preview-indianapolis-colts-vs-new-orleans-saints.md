    <strong>How the Colts win</strong>:
  </p>

  <p>
    I think the biggest key for the Colts to win is Peyton Manning staying on the field and on his feet. This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, but I think as long as Manning is on the field and on his feet the Colts will win this game. Pierre GarÃ§on and Austin Collie have come up big in the playoffs thus far and Reggie Wayne has been virtually nonexistent, although he has kept the coverage to his side which has freed things up for Collie and GarÃ§on.

    <strong>How the Saints win:</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Saints need to do exactly what Gregg Williams said, they need to hit Peyton Manning early and hit him often. Peyton Manning was sacked 10 times this year. TEN TIMES. If the Saints can get to him early and often (similar to what the Jets did in the first 28 minutes two weeks ago) then they can rattle him. If they can get Peyton rattled they need to open up the air attack and put up points early and not step off the gas. Robert Meachem and Devery Henderson MUST come up big in this game and catch at least one deep ball from Brees for the Saints to win.

  <h3>
    <strong>Matt's Prediction:</strong>
  </h3>

  <p>
    I think the Colts put up points early and don't step off the gas this game. The high flying offense of the Saints will keep them in this game but I think Peyton plays the game of his life (for the second game in a row) and the Colts roll in this one. Super Bowl MVP is always a great discussion point and if the Colts win I don't see many ways Peyton doesn't win it. Joseph Addai had 19 carries for 81 yards and 10 catches for 60 yards in the last Super Bowl and Peyton won MVP. I think if GarÃ§on can get to 10 catches and a touchdown or 8 catches and 2 touchdowns he will win MVP. If the Saints do end up winning the only person I can see winning MVP other than Drew Brees is Reggie Bush (special teams play) or Darren Sharper (2 INTs). As for the final score?

  <h3>
    <strong>Ryan's Prediction:<br /> </strong>
  </h3>

  <p>
    This is a Quarterback driven league isn't? Is it weird that the top two QBs are in the Super Bowl? Too bad both of these teams have a chance of being undefeated and they blew it (Colts gave it away), it could have been a great story. I see this one as a close game, most of the Colts games have been close this year. The better quarterback will prevail (that's Manning for those of you who don't know anything about football). The teams match up pretty well, but it will be a close and high scoring game. Defensive struggle perhaps? I just hope it was exciting as last years game. Except maybe the right team will win this year.
