    Jahvid Best has sustained what appears to be an extremely serious back/neck injury while scoring Cal's first touchdown tonight. If you did not see it Best jumped into the air to get over a defender and as he scored he landed squarely on his upper back and lower neck area. His helmet flew off and his body went instantly limp. His arms were stiff and his eyes were closed. He did not give any acknowledgment to the crowd as he was carted off. An extremely scary sight. If we get a video we will update the post.

    Our prayers are with you Jahvid.

    UPDATE FROM ESPN: Cal coach Jeff Tedford say RB Jahvid Best has movement in extremities but has a concussion.
