    Jay Glazer of Fox was the first to report it and it has now been made official according to <a href="https://twitter.com/Adam_Schefter/status/26547745972">ESPN's Adam Schefter</a>. The New England Patriots have traded Randy Moss to the Minnesota Vikings for a third-round pick in the 2011 NFL draft.
  </p>

  <p>
    It has long been rumored that Moss would make a return to Minnesota after he departed in 2004.  With the Vikings desperately trying to gain public support for a new stadium, Randy Moss should help energize the fan base and the public.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Patriots now have 2 picks in each of the first 4 rounds in next years draft. Their own pick in each round, plus the Raiders first-round pick (top 10??), Panthers second-round pick, Vikings third-round pick, and Denver's fourth-round pick.

    On a completely unrelated note, the Love Boat Scandal happened exactly 5 years ago today.
