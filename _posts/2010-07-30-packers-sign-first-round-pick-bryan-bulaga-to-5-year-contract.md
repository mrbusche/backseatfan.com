  <p>
    The Green Bay Packers have signed first round pick Bryan Bulaga to a 5 year contract worth $14.75 million with $8.76 million guaranteed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The former Iowa Hawkeye was a standout in 2008 before suffering an injury in 2009 that limited his playing time. Bulaga seemed to be a prime candidate for a holdout since he was projected to go as high as the #6 pick to the Kansas City Chiefs.

  <p>
    Bulaga the 23rd overall pick in this year's draft received a 6.9% increase in overall money and a 12.3% increase in guaranteed money over <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2009/05/2009-nfl-draft-rookie-signing-status/">last year's 23rd overall pick</a> Michael Oher.
