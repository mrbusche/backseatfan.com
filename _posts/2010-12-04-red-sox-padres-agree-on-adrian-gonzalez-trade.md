  <p>
    According to various sources the San Diego Padres have agreed to deal 1B Adrian Gonzalez to the Boston Red Sox for <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/SI_JonHeyman/status/11070898161324032">Casey Kelly</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/NCTPadres/status/11075583064674304">Anthony Rizzo and Reymond Fuentes</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    According to ESPN Boston's <a href="http://twitter.com/GordonEdes/status/11076008320966657">Gordon Ede</a>s, Theo Epstein flew from San Diego to Boston with Adrian Gonzalez.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Red Sox have received permission from Major League Baseball to negotiate with Gonzalez on a new contract, sources told ESPNs Buster Oleny, and Gonzalez's physical examination, one of the last hurdles to the deal, could happen Saturday. The team already has flown in Gonzalez.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/boston/mlb/news/story?id=5882356">Kelly</a>, 21, is considered the top prospect in the Red Sox organization by Baseball America, though he struggled a bit in his first season at Double-A in 2010. He was 3-5 with a 5.31 ERA in 21 starts for the Portland Sea Dogs, and had a 6.75 ERA in four starts in the Arizona Fall League recently.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rizzo, also 21, had 20 homers and 80 RBIs with the Sea Dogs this past season and had an .815 OPS. He was ranked the No. 3 Red Sox prospect by Baseball America.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 19-year-old Fuentes was Boston's top pick in the 2009 draft. He hit .270 with 59 runs scored and 42 stolen bases in 104 games for Class A Greenville last season. He's ranked the No. 6 Red Sox prospect by Baseball America.
  </p>

  <p>
    The trade for Gonzalez almost assuredly means that Adrian Beltre will not be returning with the Red Sox and his best offer is currently with the Athletics.
