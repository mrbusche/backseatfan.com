    Brett Favre did an Interview with Men's Journal a few months ago, right when he said he needed ankle surgery.  Now is this all a Brett Favre diabolical plot?, or is it awww shucks Brett, and he doesn't know any better?  <a href="http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/blogs/98426974.html">Star Tribune has a few pieces</a> on their site, and <a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/in-the-august-issue-favre">Men's journal has a little preview</a> as well.  I think that the issue hit the newsstands today, maybe I'll read it at the grocery store, because magazines are a waste of money unless you subscribe to them.

      “Brett talked to goddamned Ed Werder at ESPN, says he needs ankle surgery. Now why did he do that? I’ve got Childress calling. I’ve got reporterscalling all damn morning. Goddammit, why does he have to be such a goddamned drama queen? Play, don’t play, goddamn, people are getting sick of it. I’m getting sick of it! Why does he have to talk to these people? What good does it do? Ed Werder at ESPN! What’s he ever done for anybody other than say, ‘Look, look, Mommy, I got this first, ain’t I special?’ You got problems with surgery, talk to your wife. Why talk to goddamned Ed Werder?”

    To me this seems almost planned out.  Bus Cook has some sort of media guy waiting in the wings of his office.  He comes out and he says I hate media.. Then he starts talking about Brett Favre and how he keeps leaking stuff out to the press.  But wasn't it Bus Cook that <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2010/02/brett-favre-injury-pictures/">leaked this photo</a> out to a newspaper?  Isn't that asking for a little bit of drama?  But maybe it is all Favre and Bus Cook knows nothing.  Or maybe Brett Favre just really likes talking to Ed Werner.

      Favre talked about the fun he had last season, which was arguably the best of his career. He threw 33 touchdown passes and only seven interceptions. "I’ve had games when I almost threw seven picks,” Favre told Rodrick, laughing. “It was unreal. Before last year, I’d reached a point where I was sitting in meetings with guys 15 years younger than me thinking, What the hell am I doing here? Football became work. But last year it went back to being a game.”

    Last year football went back to being a game for Brett Favre.  To me those words mean that Brett Favre might be back for even two more seasons.  I have no doubt in my mind that he will be coming back this year.  The fact that it was fun for him last year, and that he loved playing for Minnesota is great.  He called it the best season of his career, maybe that's all show, but statistically it was probably the best season of his career.  The only way it could have gotten better is if the <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2010/02/brett-favre-ankle-injury-video/">Saints didn't cheat</a> and the Vikings won the super bowl?  Yes I am still bitter?

    Brett Favre came into Bus Cook's office and said he was sorry, he didn't think Ed Werner would think it was a big deal.  Then he says:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “You’d think I’d know better by now,” he says. He offers a different kind of smile: sad and weary. “I’ve learned a lot through the years. What I haven’t learned is what I’ll do and when I’ll do it.”

    I know Brett is coming back, so I am pretty sure I know what he is doing there.  When he will do it?  He will probably "test" his ankle out during training camp, but won't play in a game until the 3rd or 4th preseason game.  I am fine with that.  He is old, he needs some sort of day pass.  The saying also works when he is playing in a game.  You never know when he is just going to bust out a hail mary and throw into the end zone. He is crazy that way, and that's why we love to watch him.  I feel better now that he is on the Vikings, because I loved watching him when he was on the Packers? And I felt guilty, because I was a Vikings fan.

    Alright, I might go out and buy the magazine and read it.  I have a long car ride to LA next week and I could use a little good reading for the trip.  Maybe I will make a part two to this with a few more quotes.
