    The Denver Broncos have agree to trade Brandon Marshall to the Miami Dolphins for a 2010 2nd round pick and a report 2nd round pick in 2011. Marshall is expected to sign one of the most lucrative deals for a wide receiver in NFL history once the deal is finalized.

      I don't like this trade for the Dolphins, especially if they sign Marshall to an $8M a year or more deal. They have two pretty good running backs and already have a possession receiver with Davone Bess. I know Davone Bess isn't Brandon Marshall, but he had a breakout season last year. Greg Camarillo, Brian Hartline and Ted Ginn, Jr are their options for deep threats and I think Marshall needs to turn into a deep threat for this trade to be worth it. If that doesn't happen I don't see Marshall staying happy for more than 8 games in 2010.
