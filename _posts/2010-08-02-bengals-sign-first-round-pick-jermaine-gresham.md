  <p>
    The Cincinnati Bengals has signed their first round pick Jermaine Gresham.  The Former Oklahoma Sooner should make an immediate impact at TE for the Bengals.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bengals signed Gresham to a 5 year deal, $15.8 million contract with $9.6 million guaranteed.  The $15.8 Million total has a chance of Maxing out at $18.5 if all incentives are reached.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gresham missed the 2009 season at Oklahoma due to a knee injury, and should come back strong for the Bengals.  He is currently listed as the starting TE, and should be the starter at the beginning of the season.
