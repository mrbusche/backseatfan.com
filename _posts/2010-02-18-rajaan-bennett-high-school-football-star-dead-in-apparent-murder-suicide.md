    Powder Springs Lt. Matt Boyd says officers heard gunshots as they arrived at a home early Thursday. Inside they found the body of 18-year-old Rajaan Bennett, a running back at McEachern High School.

    Boyd says 39-year-old Clifton Steager of Milledgeville shot Bennett and then killed himself. A third person, 32-year-old Taiwan Hunter, was wounded and is in surgery.
