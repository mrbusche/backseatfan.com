  <p>
    The Seattle Seahawks have signed Edgerrin James to a one year contract. This should help boost the Seahawks run game since they have no great backs. So three mediocre running backs should equal a great running team&#8230; Not really. But hopefully someone will surface to the top and get the running game going for Seattle. James rushed for 514 yards and had 3 Tds last season, averaging 3.9 yards per carry. He did a decent job with 133 carries in Arizona last year, until he officially lost the job to Tim Hightower. Julius Jones had a pretty similar season with 698 yards and 2 TDs on 158 carries. So together they make a mediocre NFL running back with 1200 yards and 5 TDs! Equivalent to about a Jamal Lewis last year.
