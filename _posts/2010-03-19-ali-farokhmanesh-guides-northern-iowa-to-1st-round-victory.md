    Thursday may have been the greatest day of tournament basketball I have ever seen. Being a UNI alumnus, I watched the Northern Iowa game closely and after Ali Farokhmanesh hit his game winner it reminded me of a video I had been shown a while ago of Northern Iowa's last NCAA tournament victory. Farokhmanesh hit his shot from nearly the exact same spot Maurice Newby hit a game winner 20 years ago to the day when they were a 14 seed playing against #3 seed Missouri. If you can watch both videos without getting chills down your spine, please check your pulse.

    This video is super shaky, but I don't think CBS can take it down.
