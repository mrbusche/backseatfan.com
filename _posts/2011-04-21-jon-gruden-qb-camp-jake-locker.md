  <p>
    Here's another guy, and it pains me to say this, I think is going to be a bust in the NFL. I want this kid to be Â a good QB especially because it sounds like the Vikings really like him, but I don't see how a career 54% completion percentage in college is going to get any better in the NFL.<br />
