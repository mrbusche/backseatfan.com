<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Blake Griffin Hits his head on the Backboard trying to go for an alley-oop.
  </p>

  <p>
    Obviously the defender is to blame here because he was in the way of an amazing highlight real.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although, this isn't the only time this has happened to Blake Griffin&#8230;
  </p>

  <p>
    Still, he is just trying to be amazing, I blame the backboards.
