    The <a href="http://www.nascarhall.com/">NASCAR Hall of Fame</a> is kicking off its opening day with a star-studded ceremony.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beverly Perdue, governor of North Carolina, joined other NASCAR representatives for the hour long opening ceremony today.
  </p>

  <p>
    The city of Charlotte spent nearly $200 million on the project and is calling it the most technologically advanced Hall of Fame in all of sports.Â The building is 150,000-square-foot and features exhibits that recreate old-time NASCAR lore, 154 video screens, racing simulators and interactive activities.

  <p>
    The inaugural class will be inducted May 23.
