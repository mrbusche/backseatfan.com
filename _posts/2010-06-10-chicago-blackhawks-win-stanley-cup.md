    After 49 years, Chicago's wait is over. The Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup Wednesday night in overtime on a goal by Patrick Kane. Jonathan Toews was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner as MVP.  Marian Hossa, 0-2 the past two years in Stanley Cup finals, won his first cup.

    I don't think there is a better watch in sports than overtime Stanley Cup hockey. Both teams left it all on the ice, but it was  a strange ending, in what was maybe the worst celebration in the history of hockey. After Kane scored, the puck got lodged in the net and Kane was the only one who knew it went in. Only after five minutes of replay was the goal confirmed by the officials.
