  <p>
    As if anyone thought Fox News has any credibility at all it's all been lost with the latest comments from Tucker Carlson while guest hosting with Sean Hannity on Fox News. Carlson criticized President Obama for congratulation Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie for giving QB Michael Vick a second chance.

  <p>
    Carlson said he believed Vick should have been executed for his role in a dogfighting operation, &#8220;Now, I'm a Christian. I've made mistakes myself. I believe fervently in second chances, but Michael Vick killed dogs. And he did in a heartless and cruel way. And I think, personally, he shouldâ€™ve been executed for that. He wasn't.&#8221;

  <p>
    Now everyone is entitled to their own opinion on everything which allows me to say Carlson is a blubbering idiot at best and a hypocrite for claiming to be a Christian while advocating for the death of another human at worst.
