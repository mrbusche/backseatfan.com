    According to ESPNDallas.com TCU and coach Gary Patterson have agreed to terms on a long-term contract extension, according to two sources close to the situation. An official announcement is expected Wednesday morning.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sources both said part of the agreement includes pay increases for his assistant coaches.
  </p>

  <p>
    Patterson, in his 12th season at TCU and ninth as head coach, has an 85-27 record in his tenure. That includes TCU's 12-0 record this season, the school's first undefeated campaign since 1938.

    An official announcement is expected Wednesday.

    Does this officially remove Coach Patterson from consideration for the Notre Dame job? No matter what the $$ is, I think it'd be tough to turn down $5 million a year from Notre Dame
