    Here is a video of David Beckham pranking a masseuse on the Ellen Show.  Ellen is telling Beckham what to say through a hidden earpiece.

    I have to admit the Ellen Show is pretty damn funny.  My fiance watches it all the time, so I catch it every now and then.  So if you haven't seen it try check an episode out, you will probably like it.
