<div class="entry">
  <p>
    I totally forgot to include this play in my <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2010/09/football-is-back/">Football is Back</a> post. But that doens't matter, because this play deserves a post of its own. Presbyterian had this mother of all trick plays last night vs Wake Forest.

  <p>
    The Quarterback pretty much bounce passes a fumble to the WR. The WR fakes like it was an incomplete pass, and then throws the TD down the field to a wide open WR. Amazing.

  <p>
    Wake Forest went on to have the last laugh, winning the game 53-13.
