    So I have been incapacitated from turkey the past few days, sorry for no updates. I just read and watched videos about Tiger Wood's car accident. If you haven't heard, here is most of it, and my conspiracy theories.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tiger Woods was injured Friday at about 2 AM when he lost control of his SUV just outside his Florida home. Woods' wife used a golf club to smash out the back window to help get him out.
  </p>

  <p>
    Woods has been treated and released from the hospital, and is in good condition.
  </p>

  <p>
    So what the hell happened Tiger? I have a few theories to break down everything.
  </p>

  <p>
    1. He had a tournament in the morning, Tigercouldn't sleep so he took some Ambien and slept-drove down the driveway. Instead of pressing the brake as he backed up he pressed the gas, and unknowingly smashed into the fire hydrant and tree.
  </p>

  <p>
    2. Tiger and his wife were fighting and she swung a golf club at the back end of his car as he drove away lost control and he drove into a fire hydrant and a tree
  </p>

  <p>
    3. Tiger was drunk, realized he really hated that tree and fire hydrant, and ran it over to get rid of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    4. Tiger was all hyped up on Tryptophan from the turkey he had on Thanksgiving, and probably was close to unconsciousness as he drove down the driveway.
  </p>

  <p>
    5. Tiger doesn't normally drive, he probably has s driver, therefore he forgot how.
  </p>

  <p>
    6. He is so used to a golf cart where he pushes the pedal down all the way to go 12 mph. So he just floored it with his SUV.
