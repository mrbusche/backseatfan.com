    Chris Duhon and the Orland Magic have agreed to terms on a 4 year $15 million deal according to Duhon's agent. He is expected to replace Jason Williams as the backup to Jameer Nelson. Age was most likely a factor when deciding to sign Jason Williams. Duhon is 27 years old whereas Williams is 35.

    <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/nba/news/story?id=5357340">ESPN</a> was first to report the deal, which cannot be signed until July 8th
  </p>

    According to a league source Williams may still resign with Orlando although the Grizzlies and Knicks are both interested. JWill was one of the best backups last season and also performed well as a starter, but he has also made it clear he does not want to play for the veteran minimum like he did last season. Who can blame the guy?
