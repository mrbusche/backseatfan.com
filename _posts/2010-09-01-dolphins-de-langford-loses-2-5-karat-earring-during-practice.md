    Miami Dolphins defensive end Kendall Langford lost a 2.5 karat earring during practice.Â  Langford and some of his teammates spent nearly an hour going through the grass with their rakes and hands for the earring. The earring is worth about $50,000, so if you are near the Dolphins practice facility, bring your metal detector.
