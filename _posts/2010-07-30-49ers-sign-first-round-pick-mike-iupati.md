    The San Francisco 49ers have signed first-round guard Mike IupatiÂ <a href="http://twitter.com/Adam_Schefter/statuses/19925298110">to a five-year deal</a> according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.
  </p>

  <p>
    David White of the San Franciso Chronicle is reporting the deal is for <a href="http://twitter.com/bydavidwhite/statuses/19927426135">5 years $18.25 million with $10.8 million guaranteed</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Iupati was a first team All-WAC, first team All American, and was a finalist for the Outland Trophy in his senior season.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the draft many thought Iupati would have a chance to play tackle but the 49ers have put him in a good position with Joe Staley and Anthony Davis already having the tackle spots locked down.
