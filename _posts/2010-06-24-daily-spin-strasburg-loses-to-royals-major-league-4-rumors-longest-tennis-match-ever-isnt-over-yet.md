    John Isner and Nicolas Mahut played in the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon10/news/story?id=5319726">longest match in tennis history</a> which has lasted 10 hours? The match was suspended because of darkness at 59-59 in the fifth set.  They will resume play today. USA soccer stole the thunder from this match, because that is just ridiculous.  [via <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon10/news/story?id=5319726">ESPN</a>]
