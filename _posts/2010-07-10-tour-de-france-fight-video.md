    Fights make the Tour de France exciting? Carlos Barredo of Spain attacked Rui Alberto Costa of Portugal with his bike wheel. Barredo went after Costa because of Costa elbowed him in the stomach and the ribs with about 20 km to go in the stage.

  <p>
    Both Barredo and Costa were fined about $430 dollars, and were found guilty for being a "threat and menace" in the race and "poor behaviour" after the stage.

  <p>
    Only $430 for attacking someone with a wheel?!? Tour de France riders must make terrible money. If an NFL player went after another player with anything they would be fined $5k - $20k.

  <p>
    We will check in with the Tour de France again, if there is another fight, or when it is over. Anything else in between is worthless to report about.
