          Not much change at the top this week, but we do have a shakeup in the bottom 10.
        </p>

        <p>
          1. Pittsburgh Steelers (6-2) - They didn't play that well, but they still beat the Bengals
        </p>

        <p>
          2. Baltimore Ravens (6-2) - Ray Rice is really good. Anquan Boldin however needs to start showing up.
        </p>

        <p>
          3. New York Giants (6-2) - The Seahawks are really bad on the road, but what else can you say about Hakeem Nicks?He's a beast
        </p>

        <p>
          4. Indianapolis colts (5-3) - Not many teams can beat Michael Vick when he plays like that
        </p>

        <p>
          5. New York Jets (6-2) - Their running game is falling apart.
        </p>

        <p>
          6. Atlanta Falcons (6-2) - What a bad time for Roddy White to get hurt. I think it's safe to say Michael Turner is back to form though.
        </p>

        <p>
          7. New England Patriots (6-2) - The Browns aren't as bad as people think, but that was a terrible loss
        </p>

        <p>
          8. San Diego Chargers (4-5) - The Chargers are playing great football with Patrick Crayton and Seyi Ajirotutu at WR. Just wait until they get Floyd, Gates and Vincent Jackson back.
        </p>

        <p>
          9. Green Bay Packers (6-3) - The Cowboys are who we thought they were. A horrific team.
        </p>

        <p>
          10. Kansas City Chiefs (5-3) - Yes, I know they lost to the Raiders, but the Chiefs are a better team.
        </p>

        <p>
          11. Philadelphia Eagles (5-3) - When Michael Vick plays like that the Eagles are nearly impossible to beat
        </p>

        <p>
          12. Oakland Raiders (5-4) - They make a big jump this week because they showed a lot of poise in their win against the Chiefs. Great team win.
        </p>

        <p>
          13. New Orleans Saints (6-3) - When Julius Jones is your best running back, you're in trouble.
        </p>

        <p>
          14. Tennessee Titans (5-3) - Randy Moss has traditional had great first games with new teams. Look out Miami
        </p>

        <p>
          15. Miami Dolphins (4-4) - Where is Brandon Marshall?
        </p>

        <p>
          16. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-3) - Must win game at home to stay in the NFC South race against Carolina this week.
        </p>

        <p>
          17. Minnesota Vikings (3-5) - Improbably win last week against Arizona now a huge game at Solider Field this week and the possible return of Sidney Rice
        </p>

        <p>
          18. St. Louis Rams (4-4) - Steve Spagnuolo's explanation of why they didn't claim Randy Moss is a great example of why you can't help but love this team.
        </p>

        <p>
          19. Washington Redskins (4-4) - Clinton Portis may be back this week, will he be any good?
        </p>

        <p>
          20. Houston Texans (4-4) - Arian Foster is great, but the rest of the team isn't playing well right now.
        </p>

        <p>
          21. Chicago Bears (5-3) - They barely beat the Bills who don't have a win.
        </p>

        <p>
          22. Cleveland Browns (3-5) - Josh McDaniels is really wishing he had Peyton Hillis back.
        </p>

        <p>
          23. Cincinnati Bengals (2-6) - Dallas Cowboys Light? This team is bad.
        </p>

        <p>
          24. Detroit Lions (2-6) - An injury to Jason Hansen basically robbed this team of a win
        </p>

        <p>
          25. Arizona Cardinals (3-5) - After a heartbreaking loss in week 9, this is a must win game to stay in the playoff hunt.
        </p>

        <p>
          26. Seattle Seahawks (4-4) - Another road game for the Seahawks, that usually means a loss.
        </p>

        <p>
          27. Denver Broncos (2-6) - Will the Tim Tebow era begin this week?
        </p>

        <p>
          28. Jacksonville Jaguars (4-4) - David Garrard will probably throw for at least 3 TDs against the horrific Texans defense, but this team still isn't any good.
        </p>

        <p>
          29. San Francisco 49ers (2-6) Â - Frank Gore was the first player to reach 1,000 yards from scrimmage this year
        </p>

        <p>
          30. Buffalo Bills (0-8) - 3 weeks, 3 crushing losses.
        </p>

        <p>
          31. Carolina Panthers (1-7) - No Deangelo Williams, Jonathan Stewart, Matt Moore or Jeff Otah? No more wins for this team.
        </p>

        <p>
          32. Dallas Cowboys (1-7) - There isn't a team in the league they could beat right now.
