    The guys for <a href="www.dudeperfect.com">Dudeperfect.com</a> have a new video out. The Airplane Shot. What?!!? Yeah that's right, shooting a basketball from a crop duster. They didn't go up very high, but getting the timing right has to be pretty damn hard. It looks like they are sponsored by GMC now, so their tricks will probably get more elaborate, and involve trucks. My guess for the next one is the moving hoop basketball shot from truck to truck.
