    <em> </em><a href="https://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/38515187/ns/sports-player_news/">Denver Broncos RB Knowshon Moreno will be out 2-3 weeks</a> with a 'slight' hamstring tear? This is good news for Bronco fans and fantasy football enthusiasts since Moreno shouldn't miss any of the regular season due to this injury. Correll Buckhalter is also injured, so Moreno won't be losing any position battles at the moment?   [via <a href="https://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/38515187/ns/sports-player_news/">NBC Sports</a>]

Welker must be right at the edge of playing, they should probably just let him take it easy though camp if he is that close?
