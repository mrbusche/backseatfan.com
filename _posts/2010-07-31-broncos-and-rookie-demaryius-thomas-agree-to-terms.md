    Jason La Canfora from NFL.com has reported the Broncos have agreed to terms with first round pick WR Demaryious Thomas on a <a href="http://twitter.com/JasonLaCanfora/statuses/20018920231">5 year contract</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lindsay Jones from the Denver Post is reporting Thomas received a $12.155 million deal that could max out at $15.5 million with escalators. $9.35 million of the contract is guaranteed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thomas had 46 catches for 1154 yards last year for Georgia Tech. He was basically the only receiver on the team (next highest had 8 catches), but the Yellow Jackets run the ball like crazy so his low reception total isn't surprising. Thomas still had a breakout season with 9 plays greater than 50 yards.

  <p>
    His highlight video isn't that long but it's still impressive
