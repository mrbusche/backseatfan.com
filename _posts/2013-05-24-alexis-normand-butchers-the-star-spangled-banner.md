    Alexis Normand butchered the (American) National Anthem during the 2013 Memorial Cup.
  </p>

    But hey, at least the Canadian jazz singer said she was sorry through twitter.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “I’m embarrassed and deeply sorry. I wish I’d had more time to learn the American anthem,”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

    I'm sure she is a fine Jazz Singer, and next time she will be much more prepared, she will at least look at the lyrics once. Honestly, I don't know too many more words to "O Canada" besides O Canada.
