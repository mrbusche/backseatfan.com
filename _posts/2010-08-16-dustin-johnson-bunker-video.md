    Dustin Johnson's Bunker shot caused him to have a 2 stroke penalty. Watch the video and let us know if you think that is a bunker. Because it just looks like a pile of sand after someone hit out of a bunker. Complete bullshit.

      "Walking up there, it never once crossed my mind that I was in a sand trap," Johnson said afterward. "The only worse thing that could have happened was if I made that putt."

    Dustin Johnson tied for fifth place, maybe if grounds crew at The Whistling Straits took care of their course he could have gotten first place.
