  <p>
    2K Sports will be awarding a 1 million dollars to the first person to pitch a verified perfect game in Major League Baseball® 2K11. They ran this contest last year and one lucky gamer got to cash a million dollar check. MLB 2k11 comes out March 8th, and the race to a perfect game starts on Major League Baseball’s Opening Day, April 1, 2011. This will give gamers on Xbox 360 and PS3 nearly a month to hone their gaming skills before embarking on a quest that only 20 pitchers in baseball history have accomplished.
