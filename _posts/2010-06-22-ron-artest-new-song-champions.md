    Right after Ron Artest won the NBA Championship he was off doing crazy press conferences. Then he went to a radio station to sample his new track called "Champions", by the end of the weekend he made an official video. My guess is even if he lost he probably would have made a new rap song. Although that one might have been more about the voices in his head.
