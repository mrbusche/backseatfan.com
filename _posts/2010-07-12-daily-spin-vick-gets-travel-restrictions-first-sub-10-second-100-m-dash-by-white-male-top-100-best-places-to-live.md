    <em>Daily Spin, with all that news out there you probably just want one place to go in the morning?  Money Magazines Top 100 Best Places to live came out, I don't like their order of cities, but at least where I live it is on the list.</em>

    Michael Vick faces <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5370940&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines">travel restrictions</a> due to his probation. Vick can't travel outside the state of Pennsylvania? Wow, it's like he's on some sort of leash? I hope it's one of those with spikes that dig into his neck..

    Iowa DE Broderick<a href="http://www.press-citizen.com/article/20100709/HAWKS0104/100709001/Iowa-defensive-end-Broderick-Binns-charged-with-OWI"> Binns gets a DUI</a>? Looks like Broderick will probably be suspended for the Hawkeyes first game of the season.  3  DUI's this year for Hawkeye Football, really not that bad for Iowa standards.  [via <a href="http://www.press-citizen.com/article/20100709/HAWKS0104/100709001/Iowa-defensive-end-Broderick-Binns-charged-with-OWI">Press Citizen</a>]

    <a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20100712/SPORTS04/7120329/1004/SPORTS/Pacers-getting-33.5-million-to-stay">Indiana Pacers are staying</a> in Indianapolis, but it will cost taxpayers at least $33.5 million over the next three years? If I was an Indiana tax payer I would be pissed.  No chance of the Pacers winning a title over the next three years anyway, let them move and grab the next franchise instead?
