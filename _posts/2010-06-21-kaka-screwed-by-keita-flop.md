    Ivory Coast's Keita flopped a blow to the face by Brazil's Kaka. Kaka got a red card. Maybe they should consider doing a instant replay during World Cup Matches.

    Kaka has to sit out against Brazil's next match, which is Portugal. Brazil has already qualified, so it is just for the top spot in their group.
