    No one is reporting why Tony Romo and Jessica Simpson broke up, but Colin Cowherd of the <a href="https://sports.espn.go.com/espnradio/show?showId=theherd">Thundering Herd</a> radio show has his own theory, which I believe to be very accurate.
  </p>

  <p>
    They've been dating for 2 1/2 years and everyone knows what happens when you approach your 3rd anniversary, commitment. According to Colin the steps in a relationship tend to go like so:
  </p>

  <p>
    The 1st Anniversary - "The Sexy Anniversary" You take her on a trip to Mexico give her lingerie, anything that makes her look beautiful.
  </p>

  <p>
    The2nd Anniversary - "The I love you Anniversary" It's the I love you, it's not just about making out anniversary.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 3rd anniversary - commitment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem comes with the 3rd anniversary. You've done the sexy anniversary, you've done the I love you anniversary, and now all that is left is commitment. The girls don't fall for the sex stuff anymore, they know you love them, and now they want a commitment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anniversary #3 broke up Tony and Jessica folks.
