    Jimenez hit a terrible 3rd shot on the 17th hole which landed close to the Stone Wall at the British Open. The only way to get it onto the green was to hit the shot off of the stone wall. <strong>What?</strong> Jiminez hit this amazing shot off the wall, and the ball lands on the green.

    That is a pretty ballsy shot, and it contains both skill and luck.  You have to know what you are doing in order to do it correctly (well I could attempt it but it I would end up hitting myself in the face).  But a stone wall isn't flat, it has different angles, textures, shapes, and a ball could land anywhere.  It is one of the most amazing shots I've ever seen.
