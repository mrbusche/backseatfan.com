    I have a 10 minute drive in the morning. 20 minutes at lunch, and 10 minutes after work. That is more than enough time to get some good sports talk radio in.

    I think I have a love hate relationship with ESPN Radio. For the most part I like the content on ESPN Radio, I just can't stand the format. I'm not really an <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/writer/Jay-Glazer-FOXSports.com-Senior-NFL-Writer?authorId=228">ESPN hater</a>, I go there multiple times everyday. I just can't stand the crazy amount of commercials they play on the Radio.
  </p>

  <p>
    The content for the most part is either <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gyhd0Q6hUlU">funny</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggBAo3_Zj3c">knowledgeable</a>, but I hate three things about ESPN Radio - <a href="https://www.tidefans.com/forums/football/94767-colin-cowherd-says-usc-should-ranked-above-alabama.html">Constant homer-ism</a>, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mcc">Bashing the Big 10</a>, and More commercials than the actual broadcast. I can live with the first two, but the commercials are just annoying.

      I first got a teaser from Colin Cowherd when I got in the car. That's fine I am used to that. I then switched between 5 minutes worth of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h05ZQ7WHw8Y">pointless commercials</a>, and 5 minutes of Rome, which depending on the day, could also be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddCyLpid1Jo">pointless</a>. Then finally The Herd comes back on. All he did was repeat his same teaser, and he said said"we'll be back in 90 seconds."
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH1H13nl01M">WTF?</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Colin Cowherd had a 20 second segment yesterday between commercials.I understand the concept of a teaser, but this is just outrageous. I listened to close to 10 minutes of Commercials and I didn't get a single bit of actual sports talk radio.
    </p>

    <p>
      They actually charge money to download an iPhone app for this crap. $2.99. Get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cyAqEjZ2as">all the commercials</a> you can listen to for only 2.99. Sweet Deal.
    </p>

    <p>
      They also market that you can download <a href="http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/">podcasts</a> from this great App, well you can download them off <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/artist/espn/id127434126" target="_blank">iTunes for free</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only Sports talk show I can recommend is the Dan Patrick Show, there aren't that many commercials on there, <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/danpatrick/streamingaudio/" target="_blank">great content</a>, and he has a<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-dan-patrick-show/id335849417?mt=8"> free iPhone app</a>. Plus he is pretty much better than all the shows on ESPN Radio.
    </p>

    <p>
      So no more talk ESPN talk radio for me, I am going to stick with downloading podcasts, and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">listening</span> fast-forwarding through the 1 minute commercial in the introduction.
