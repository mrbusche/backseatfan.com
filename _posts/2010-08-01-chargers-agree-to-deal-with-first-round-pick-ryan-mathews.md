<div class="entry">
  <p>
    The San Diego Chargers have agreed to a deal with first round draft pick running back Ryan Mathews.
  </p>

  <p>
    Terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but based on the pick ahead of Mathews (Anthony Davis) he should receive a little less than the $26.5 million overall and $15.945 million guaranteed Davis received.
  </p>

  <p>
    The signing finishes off San Diego's draft class and leaves just 7 first round and one second round pick unsigned.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mathews ran for 1808 yards on just 276 carries, averaging 6.6 yards per carry as a junior for Fresno State last year.
