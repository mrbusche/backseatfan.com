    I hate to keep comparing every great dunk to Blake Griffin's over the car dunk.  But it's hard not to since he set such a low standard at the NBA dunk contest finale.  Here is a dunk by Guy Dupuy during the Women's Euroleague All Star Game 2011. This is what Blake Griffin's dunk should of looked like&#8230; Minus all of the foreign yelling, music, and shaky camera movement.
