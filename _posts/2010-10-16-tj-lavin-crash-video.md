    I've got to warn everyone that this video is pretty gruesome. Two seconds after he hits the dirt ten of his friends are already by his side., shows what kind of guy TJ is.

    There was an update posted to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/tjlavin/status/27375986283">TJ's twitter account</a> yesterday afternoon.

    "Ty update: the swelling in his brain is going down faster than expected. He's not out of the woods but it is looking better!"

    Here's too a speedy recovery for the Cuthroat host.<br />
