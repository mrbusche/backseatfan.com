    Health Central Hospital confirm Barbro Holmberg, Elin Nordegren's mom, was in the ambulance coming from Tiger Woods' home early this morning after complaining of stomach pains.

    She is still in the hospital and listed in stable condition.

    Although I don't really find this to be news. Those of you following the Tiger beat would like to know who was in the ambulance. It was Tiger's mother in law. Not his wife. She probably busted a hemorrhoid or caused herself to get an ulcer by yelling at Tiger?
