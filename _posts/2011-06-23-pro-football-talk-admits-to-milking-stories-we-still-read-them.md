<div class="entry">
  <p>
    I woke up this morning to see a 4th installment of the Adrian Peterson Camp Story from Pro Football Talk and of course because I'm an unabashed Vikings homer, I clicked on the story just like I did the previous 2 reposts and read nothing new.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then I saw a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/RossTuckerNFL">Ross Tucker</a> to Pro Football Talk, "I'll buy you a burger some time if you find a way to get a 5th post out of the Peterson camp story." I have no doubt they will post at least 4 more stories rehashing the same story and all of us NFL deprived football fans will read those as well, hoping for new information.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was shocked to see <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ProFootballTalk">Pro Football Talk</a> respond with a "? I can milk a cow until dust comes out. But I don't eat the cow, so you'll need an enticement other than a burger."
  </p>

  <p>
    So, there you have it, PFT admits to milking stories and yet we will all continue to read them, hoping they provide us with new information.
  </p>

  <p>
    In case PFT decides to remove that tweet later, here's a screenshot of the conversation.
