    I'm not sure if everyone is aware, but every NFL game Gus Johnson calls has a chance to go down as a classic and this one was no exception.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a back and forth game that featured two 300 yard passing games and two receivers with 140+ yard days this game looked to be going into overtime until Matt Schaub threw an inexcusable pass to Joel Dreessen that he then fumbled and was recovered by Justin Durant. What came next is something only Gus Johnson should be allowed to call.

    <a href="https://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/09000d5d81c1aac7/WK-10-Can-t-Miss-Play-Hail-Mary">David Garrard threw a 50 yard Hail Mary</a> pass to that was batted down by Glover Quinn and bounced right into the hands of a sprinting Mike Thomas. If there is not a website dedicating to what game Gus Johnson is calling each week there needs to be. It's hard not to love this guy.
