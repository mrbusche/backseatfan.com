  <p>
    According to two league sources the Seattle Seahaws with either cut or trade T.J. Houshmandzadeh and insert former first round draft pick Mike Williams as a starting wide receiver.
  </p>

  <p>
    Houshmandzadeh is due $7 million this season, but can sign with any team for any amount of money if he is released. If he signed a deal for the veteran minimum of $850,000 the Seahawks would need to pay the remaining $6.15 million.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some potential suitors for Houshmandzadeh, either via trade or if he were released would be the Browns, Redskins, and the Bills. All three teams lack wide receiver depth and in the Browns case, they really lack any proven wide receiver at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Panthers have been mentioned as possible contenders for his services, but SI's <a href="https://twitter.com/SI_PeterKing/status/22924914872">Peter King points ou</a>t that Brandon LaFell is much better than we think he is.
  </p>

  <p>
    Chad OchocCinco tweeted that he would gladly have <a href="https://twitter.com/OGOchoCinco/status/22931027216">Housh back on the Bengals</a>. The Bengals actually have good WR depth already with Chad, Terrell Owens, Jordan Shipley, Jerome Simpson and Andre Caldwell. I don't see room for Housh on the Bengals this year.
