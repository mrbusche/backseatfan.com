    The Los Angeles Angels have acquired Dan Haren from the Arizona Diamondbacks for Joe Saunders, minor league pitchers Rafael Rodriguez and Patrick Corbin and a player to be named later.

    Haren is struggling this season with a 4.60 ERA, but his career ERA is 3.71.

    According to <a href="https://twitter.com/nickpiecoro/status/19525646315">Nick Piecoro</a> of the Arizona Republic, the PTBNL is a top prospect, but is not OF Mike Trout.
