    Here is a spot by Tom Brady supporting  World Wildlife Fund's Earth Hour.  Not sure if they were going for the cheesy douche - bag look, but they accomplished it!  And is he just going to turn of the lights and leave that food on the table?  What a waste!

    Remember folks, Earth Hour  on March 27th @ 8:30 PM, turn off your damn lights.
