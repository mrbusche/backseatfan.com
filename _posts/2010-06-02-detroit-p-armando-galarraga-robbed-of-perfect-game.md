<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Detroit P Armanda Galarraga was just robbed of a perfect game in one of the worst baseball calls I've ever seen. The good news is Major League Baseball has instant replay, so everything has been fixed. Oh, they don't have instant replay? That's terrible. I hope Bud Selig announces tomorrow that Galarraga has been awarded a 28 out perfect game. Video of the play below, it's not the best quality, but it's much better than when I took videos with my LG Dare.
