    ESPN pulled this LeBron James story yesterday, and they stated today that they will not be publishing <strong>ever</strong>.  This doesn't really sound like it was accidentally published, like ESPN stated earlier.  It sounds more like LeBron got pissed because he didn't know about it, called ESPN and ESPN does what LeBron says.  Now doesn't this make you hate LeBron even more?  We posted story on Daily Spin yesterday, but if you didn't see it here it is plus the note from ESPN:

      Arash Markazi's ESPN.com story on LeBron James will not be posted again. Here are comments from Markazi & ESPN.com's Rob King:
    </p>

    <p>
      “ESPN.com will not be posting the story in any form. We looked into the situation thoroughly and found that Arash did not properly identify himself as a reporter or clearly state his intentions to write a story. As a result, we are not comfortable with the content, even in an edited version, because of the manner in which the story was reported. We’ve been discussing the situation with Arash and he completely understands. To be clear, the decisions to pull the prematurely published story and then not to run it were made completely by ESPN editorial staff without influence from any outside party.” Markazi: “I have been in conversations with ESPN.com’s editors and, upon their complete review, understand their decision not to run the story. It is important to note that I stand by the accuracy of the story in its entirety, but should have been clearer in representing my intent to write about the events I observed.”
