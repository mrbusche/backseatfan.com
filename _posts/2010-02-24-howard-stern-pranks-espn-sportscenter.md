    Former Philadelphia Eagles RB Brian Westbrook called into SportsCenter yesterday, and ESPN had to be delighted. The only problem was it wasn't Brain Westbrook, it was Howard Stern's Captain Janks.

  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Brian Westbrook</span> Captain Janks: &#8220;I look forward to a future of worshiping the prostate of Howard Stern.&#8221;
  </p>

  <p>
    Scott Van Pelt: &#8220;Oh Boy, We got that&#8221;
  </p>

  <p>
    I am pretty sure Janks said &#8220;See you on YouTube&#8221; at the end when he got cut off.
  </p>

  <p>
    Scott handled it all pretty well, but I would love to see the off camera footage afterwords. This wasn't the first time, and I am sure it won't be the last time we hear from the &#8220;worshipers of Howard Sterns prostate&#8221;
