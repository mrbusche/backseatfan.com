    Former Philadelphia Eagles RB Brian Westbrook called into SportsCenter yesterday, and ESPN had to be delighted. The only problem was it wasn't Brain Westbrook, it was Howard Stern's Captain Janks.

  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Brian Westbrook</span> Captain Janks: "I look forward to a future of worshiping the prostate of Howard Stern."
  </p>

  <p>
    Scott Van Pelt: "Oh Boy, We got that"
  </p>

  <p>
    I am pretty sure Janks said "See you on YouTube" at the end when he got cut off.
  </p>

  <p>
    Scott handled it all pretty well, but I would love to see the off camera footage afterwords. This wasn't the first time, and I am sure it won't be the last time we hear from the "worshipers of Howard Sterns prostate"
