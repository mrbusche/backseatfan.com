  <p>
    Pittsburgh Steeler's WR Santonio Holmes was traded to the New York Jets for a 5th round pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. Holmes is suspended for 4 games next year for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. So the Jets get a WR for 12 games for a 5th rounder, which isn't too bad of a deal.

  <p>
    The Jets have three #2 WRs, a quality TE, LT, Shonn Greene, and Leon Washington. They are in a better position than they were last year, especially with Sanchez having a year under his belt.

  <p>
    The Steelers seem to just be dumping a troubled WR, and just trying to get something in return.
