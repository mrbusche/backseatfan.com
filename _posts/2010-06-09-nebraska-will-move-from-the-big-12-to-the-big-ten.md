    According to ESPN's Chris Mortensen, sources have told him that Nebraska AD Tom Osborne informed staff that the school will make move to the Big Ten.

    I think the Big Ten tries to add 4 more teams to get to 16 and the Pac 10 takes their pick of the remaining teams to get itself to 16.

    If that seems to crazy, it's also possible the Big 12 makes a strong proposal to get TCU to join the Big 12, they may also take a shot at adding Utah or Boise State, although both are pretty far away geographically.

    What do you all think happens?
