    Youtube Video was taken down, but I was sent <a href="http://www.tmz.com/videos?autoplay=true&mediaKey=9794715a-0202-440f-8c52-8424f433f60e">this link of it on TMZ</a>, Thanks Jocelyn!. A lot of people are saying it sounded like an iPhone fart machine, but who knows? Only Tiger. Pretty funny though.

    Update from TMZ:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>CBS</strong> is broken-hearted, swearing Tiger wasn't the one who farted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moonves' minions have finally responded to <strong>FartGate '09</strong>, telling TMZ <strong>Tiger Woods</strong> wasn't gassy on 18 at the <strong>Buick Open</strong> - and the obvious flatulent sound came from somebody else.
  </p>

  <p>
    But CBS didn't crack this caper - refusing to say who cut the cheese.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mystery remains?
