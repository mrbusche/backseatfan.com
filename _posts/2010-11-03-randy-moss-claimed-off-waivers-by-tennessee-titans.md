<div class="entry">
  <p>
    The Tennessee Titans have claimed Randy Moss off waivers from the Minnesota Vikings.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the 1998 NFL Draft 20 teams passed on Randy Moss as the Minnesota Viking selected him with the 21st pick and Moss had one of the greatest seasons by a rookie in NFL history.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2010 21 teams passed on Randy Moss in waiver claims, will Moss have the same fate he did in 1998? With Kerry Collins at quarterback Randy Moss will still be a top 5 wide receiver in this league. With Vince Young at quarterback Moss should continue to be a top 15 wide receiver in the national football league.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're in a fantasy league I think Moss is a top 15 receiver with Vince Young starting. If you can get a top 10 WR for him I think you have to deal him away.
