  <p>
    The National Football League has suspended Buffalo Bills TE Shawn Nelson 4 games for violating the league's substance abuse policy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nelson's suspension will begin September 4th and he will be forbidden at the Bills' facilities until October 4th.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nelson was expected to be the starting TE in Buffalo this season, but Michael Matthews and Jonathan Stupar had been getting reps ahead of Nelson in training camp.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nelson was a fourth round pick in 2009. His suspension will cost him just over $92,000.
