  <p>
    Joey Chestnut has won's Nathan's 2010 Hot Dog Eating Contest by eating 54 hot dogs. This is his fourth consecutive title. Six time winner Takeru Kabayashi did not compete this year because of a 'contract disupte' with Major League Eating.

    This was one of the more boring contests I can remember, Chestnut led from the beginning and the contest was never in doubt. Tim &#8220;Eater X&#8221; Janus finished 2nd and Patrick Bertoletti finished 3rd in this years' contest eating 45 and 37 respectively.
