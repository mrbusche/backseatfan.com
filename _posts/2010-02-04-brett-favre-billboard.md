    I want him back, I can't deny it. Please come back Brett. Please come back!

    Chances of Brett Favre buying a billboard and posting his <a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2010/02/brett-favre-injury-pictures/">ankle picture</a> on it with a simple &#8220;<strong>No</strong>&#8220;? 1 in 10.

    The Vikings will be &#8220;Good&#8221; with Sage or Jackson. But they can't be &#8220;Great&#8221; without Favre or another top QB (McNabb??). One more year is all I am asking, then we can hand the reigns off to Childress' next prodigy.
