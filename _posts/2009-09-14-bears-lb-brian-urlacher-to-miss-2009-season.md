    Brian Urlacher announced in a text message this morning that his 'season is over'. Urlacher dislocated his right wrist in Sunday's game in the first quarter. It's terrible news for Urlacher who was injured most of last season with back and neck injuries.

    The Bears will have to consider moving Lance Briggs to middle linebacker with the bad news. Hunter Hillenmeyer is obviously no Lance Briggs or Brian Urlacher but he's not terrible. I think Briggs is a much better fit as middle linebacker, but Derrick Brooks is still a free agent and I think he could be signed very reasonably. Not to mention Brooks is a very intelligent player and could help out the young guys on that defense.

    The <a href="https://blogs.chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/huddleup/2009/09/brian-urlacher-out-for-the-season-with-wrist-injury.html">Chicago Tribune</a>, citing anonymous sources, reported on Sunday night that Urlacher will have surgery back in Chicago.

    "It's always tough to have your leader go down," Briggssaid, "He knows the defense better than anybody and he communicates everything to everyone else."

    The team has not given the official word, but Lovie Smith is expected to address the issue during his afternoon press conference.
