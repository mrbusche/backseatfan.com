  <p>
    Police have charged University of Virgina Men's Lacrosse Player George Huguely with first degree murder in conjunction with the death of University of Virginia Women's Lacrosse player Yeardly Love.
  </p>

  <p>
    Early this morning in Charlottesville General District Court, Huguely’s lawyers described the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/lacrosse/2010-05-03-virginia-huguely-murder-charge_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip">death as accidental</a>. Which is obviously false.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is the statement read by Huguley's attorney:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "Because this case involves an active, ongoing investigation, any comment on the specific facts would be inappropriate at this time. Until more information becomes available, it is our hope that no conclusions will be drawn or judgments made about George or his case. However, we are confident that Ms. Love's death was not intended, but an accident with a tragic outcome. In the meantime, George is withdrawing from the University of Virginia and remains in the custody of authorities. Grief has descended on this community as we attempt to understand what happened and why. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who grieve this terrible loss."
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Huguely admitted to police that he kicked his right foot through the door,and “shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall,” according to an affidavit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Affidavits requesting search warrants described witnesses finding Love face down on her pillow in her bedroom. Her right eye was swollen shut, there was a pool of blood on the pillow, and her face was bruised. The door to the room had been forced open and had a hole in it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Huguely seems to be admitting that he a physical confrontation with Love, but we will see how things unfold over time. We will keep you posted.
