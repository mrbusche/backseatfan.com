    Kevin Garnett was ejected last night because he threw an elbow at Quentin Richardson and started a fight. Garnett was huddled around the injured Paul Pierce, when Richardson came up behind Garnett. Â Something drew Garnett to shove Richardson out of the way, and then throw an elbow to Richardson's head.

    Garnett received two technical fouls and was ejected, and will probably be suspended for a couple of games.

    Richardson on what happened:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      &#8220;I was trying to get over there to take the ball out of bounds and he started to talk to me so I talked back. I don't have any business talking to him. He was on the ground crying. I don't know what was going on, two actresses over there, that's what they are &#8230; They're not those characters they portray. They're not who they say they are. Garnett and Pierce, they're good basketball players, and that's about it &#8230; Sometimes [Pierce] falls like he's about to be out for the season and then he gets right up &#8230; I don't like them, and they know it.&#8221;

    Not sure who is to blame, but I assume Garnett was just being a giant baby. He complains and pouts more than any other NBA player.
