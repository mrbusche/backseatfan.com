    Nick Novak, the kicker for the San Diego Chargers, takes a quick piss on the sidelines on national television during the San Diego - Denver Broncos game. Needless to say, kicking the winning field goal scares the piss out of him.

    Knowing that Nate Kaeding will come back next year and take over the job again, this puts a yellow stain on Novak's record.  He is really pissing away his future, nobody wants a kicker that will piss his pants.  I think that's enough puns for now.

    He really pissed the game way.  Ok, I'm done.
