    Not sure about everyone else but every year they have the One Shining Moment Tribute after the NCAA Tournament I get choked up. This is the first one I can remember watching. My favorite part is at 2:40 when Mateen Cleaves runs around the court like Brett Favre does after throwing a TD. Speaking of Favre, did everyone know <a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2009/07/favre-to-stay-retired/">he's staying retired</a>?
