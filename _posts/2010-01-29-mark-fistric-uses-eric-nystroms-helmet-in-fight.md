    Eric Nystrom (Calgary Flames) vs. Mark Fistric (Dallas Stars)
  </p>

  <p>
    Fistric takes of Nytrom's helmet, and uses it against him. Funny thing is if that is done in football, that person will be out for a year. But if its done in hockey a 5 minute penalty for fighting, and a 10 minute penalty for trying to injure. Also note, Fistric has been fined for the incident, but not suspended.

    And yes, that is correct we covered hockey for the first time in 7 months.
