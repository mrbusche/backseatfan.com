    Brad Childress testified in the Pat and Kevin Williams' Starcaps case today. Childress said under oath Friday that he didn't leak any information to the media in 2008 that defensive linemen Kevin and Pat Williams had tested positive for a banned substance.

    But what interests me most is what Williams' lawyer, Peter Ginsberg, asked last:
  </p>

  <p>
    With the Brad Childress under oath, Ginsberg asked, "Now that I have you in this position, who's going to be your quarterback next year?" Most in the room laughed loudly, and Childress didn't answer.

  <p>
    Interesting question to plead the fifth on. Sounds suspicious to me, like Childress is knowingly hiding something!!!
