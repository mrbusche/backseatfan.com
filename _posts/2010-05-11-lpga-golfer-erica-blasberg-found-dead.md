    The case is currently under investigation, and No cause of death has been disclosed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Henderson police spokesman Keith Paul said that officers responded to a 911 call and were dispatched to Blasberg's house around 3 p.m. Sunday. Paul declined to say who made the call since it was part of the investigation.

    “At first glance, it looks like she might have taken her own life, but at second glance, something is very, very strange about it. We're waiting for the police to make an investigation." Mel Blasberg told the Press-Enterprise via phone
  </p>

  <p>
    Blasberg had a successful collegiate career at the University of Arizona, where she played just two years before turing Pro in June 2004.

  <p>
    Blasberg played her only LPGA Tour event this year just two weeks ago in Mexico and tied for 44th place.

  <p>
    We will keep an eye on the case to see if it develops. Our thoughts and Prayers go out to the Blasberg family.
