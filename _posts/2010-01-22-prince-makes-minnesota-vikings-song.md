    So this isn't some of his best work by any means, but it is still a nice gesture.

    Purple and Gold Lyrics
  </p>

  <p>
    the veil of the sky draws open<br /> the roar of the chariots touch down<br /> we r the ones who have now come again<br /> and walk upon water like solid ground<br /> as we approach the throne we won't bow down<br /> this time we won't b denied
  </p>

  <p>
    raise every voice and let it b known<br /> in the name of the purple and gold
  </p>

  <p>
    we come in the name of the purple and gold<br /> all of the odds r in r favor<br /> no prediction 2 bold<br /> we r the truth if the truth can b told<br /> long reign the purple and gold
  </p>

  <p>
    the eyes say ready 4 battle<br /> no need 4 sword in hand<br /> we r all amped up like a rock n roll band<br /> ready 2 celebrate every score<br /> ready 2 fight the elegant war<br /> ready 2 hear the crowd roar
  </p>

  <p>
    that's what we came 4<br /> and so much more<br /> in the name of the purple and gold
  </p>

  <p>
    r spirits may b tired<br /> r bodies may b worn<br /> but since this day is r destiny<br /> r history â€“ that's y we must b<br /> 4ever strong as the wind that blows the Vikings' horn<br /> in the name of the purple and gold
  </p>
