    Stephen Strasburg debut was impressive, really impressive. I didn't expect 14 strikeouts. He struck out his seven final batters in a row. I know he was playing the Pirates, but it was still amazing. The movement on his ball was crazy, he is going to live up to the hype. Curt Schilling officially splurged his pants a little last night.
