    I know this is a little late, but in case you haven't heard, Gaines Adams has passed away. The autopsy showed Adams had an enlarged heart, which could lead to cardiac arrest. Gaines was only 26 years old. Adams was selected fourth overall in the 2007 NFL draft by Tampa Bay, he was traded to the Chicago Bears in October for a second-round pick in the 2010 draft. He still had his whole career ahead of him, the Bears thought he would make an impact next season.
