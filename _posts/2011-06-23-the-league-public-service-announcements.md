    The League on FX is sending out public service announcements to the NFL. I have to say they are hilarious, true, and needed. I know they are close to an agreement, but really, they need to get this done. Seriously. Anyway, here are some great PSA from The League (Great show about fantasy football, if you had no idea what it was).

    All of these videos bring up one question. Not is the NFL going to play this year, because they are. The one burning question that every League fan is wondering&#8230;

    Is Pete out of the league?
