  <p>
    Alabama are Iowa are the only 7-0 teams in the nation but Florida is the initial #1 in the BCS Rankings. If Florida continues to struggle against subpar competition I don't see how they can continue to be the #1 team. Alabama has faced a much more difficult schedule, very similar to what Boise State has had thus far this year.<br /> If Boise State wins out like it appears they can, it would still be a longshot for them to make the national championship game. Cincinnati and Iowa both have more difficult schedules than Boise State and if all 3 go undefeated, which is unlikely, Boise State would likely be the team left out. None of which would matter if 2/3 of Florida, Alabama and Texas go undefeated.

    USC is the highest ranked team with a loss, but with 4 road wins against top 30 teams that shouldn't surprise anyone
