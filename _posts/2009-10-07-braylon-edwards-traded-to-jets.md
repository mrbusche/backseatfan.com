    The Jets agreed to send special teams player Jason Trusnik, wide receiver Chansi Stuckey, a 3rd and a 5th round draft pick to Cleveland for Braylon Edwards.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rumor has it when Chansi Stuckey heard the news he walked into Rex Ryan's office and said "Hey! what did I do?!"
  </p>

  <p>
    The word on the street is that Braylon Edwards assaulted a friend of LeBron James outside a Cleveland nightclub Monday night. So we think that <a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2009/10/lebron-james-trades-braylon-edwards-to-jets/">LeBron James made the Cleveland Browns trade Edwards</a> because he didn't want him in Cleveland anymore, there are no facts behind this by the way.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jets get the big play receiver that Mark Sanchez needed, and the Browns get rid of Braylon Edwards. So really it is a win-win. Earlier this year the Browns shipped off Kellen Winslow to Tampa Bay for a 2nd and a 5th rounder, which seems to have worked out for the Browns. Even though they have had zero production on offense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Chansi Stuckey is a decent receiver who could actually do fairly well for the Browns. Not sure how much he can contribute for their crappy offense this year, but again there is always next year.

  <p>
    <strong>The Browns WRs</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Mohamed Massaquoi - Rookie<br /> Joshua Crubbs - Return Specialist turned WR (also their best QB)<br /> Mike Furrey -Veteran from University of Northern Iowa - Go Panthers!<br /> Brian Robuskie - Rookie<br /> Chansi Stuckey - Mediocre WR
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't see anyone that jumps out and scares me, which is never good. Mohamed Massaqoi and Joshua Cribbs could break out this year, but all the Browns have at WR is potential.
  </p>

  <p>
    The good news for the Browns is they play the Lions, Chiefs and Raiders this season so it is unlikely they will go winless, but it looks like the Browns have already given up on the season. With the first pick in the 2010 NFL draft?.
