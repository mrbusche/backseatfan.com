<div class="entry">
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: small;">This year, more than any other year it is important to get a clear cut #1 receiver on your team. I think there are 9 #1 fantasy receivers this year, after that the available options get pretty slim.</span>
  </p>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>1. Andre Johnson, Hou</strong> - I hate following what everyone else says, but he's the clear cut #1</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>2. Randy Moss, NE</strong> - Until he gives a reason he shouldn't be #2, he's #2.</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <div id="_mcePaste">
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>3. Miles Austin, Dal</strong> - Roy Williams is terrible and I don't think Dez Bryant is ready for prime time</span>
    </div>

    <div id="_mcePaste">
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>4. Roddy White, Atl</strong> - Had 1153 yards even though they had a terrible run game from week 9 on. The return of Harry Douglas helps as well</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>5. Larry Fitzgerald, Ari</strong> - The knee sprain doesn't bother me, Matt Leinart does</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>6. Brandon Marshall, Mia</strong> - He only had 3 100 yard games last year, but Chad Henne is a big step up from Kyle Orton</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>7.  Calvin Johnson, Det</strong> - Has the ability to be the most prolific fantasy receiver, but can Nate Burleson draw away coverage?</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>8. Greg Jennings, GB</strong> - Had a "down year" last year, but still finished with 1,113 yards. He will improve on the 4 TDs from last year</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>9. Reggie Wayne, Ind</strong> - Faded in the 2nd half last year and has Pierre Garcon hot on his heels</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>10. Marques Colston, NO</strong> - Drew Brees is still his QB, right? He was also third in red zone targets last year</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>11. Anquan Boldin, Bal</strong> - His TDs will increase from the 4 he had last year. Ray Rice running the ball well will help him a lot</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>12. Steve Smith, NYG</strong> - The "other Steve Smith" will easily outshine the "real Steve Smith" this year</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <div id="_mcePaste">
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>13. Michael Crabtree, SF</strong> - If Alex Smith can get the ball to him he will get to 1,000 yards</span>
    </div>

    <div id="_mcePaste">
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>14. Sidney Rice, Min</strong> - The hip injury concerns me a little bit, but Rice catches everything thrown his way</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>15. Steve Smith, Car</strong> - I like Matt Moore throwing to him, but who will draw coverage away from him?</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>16. Hines Ward, Pit</strong> - He's not a sexy pick, but he's nearly a lock for at least 4 catches a game</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>17. DeSean Jackson, Phi</strong> - I think Maclin comes on strong this year to steal some of Jackson's thunder</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>18. Pierre Garcon, Ind</strong> - Peyton Manning has never had a problem supporting 2 great fantasy receivers</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>19. Wes Welker, NE </strong>- Welker is as tough as they come and he'll be on the field week 1, catching 120 balls again</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>20. Chad Ochocinco, Cin</strong> - With TO in town Ocho's targets will go down and so will his production</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <div id="_mcePaste">
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>21. Hakeem Nicks, NYG</strong> - Nicks has great hands and surprisingly has a QB who threw for 4,000 yards last year.</span>
    </div>

    <div id="_mcePaste">
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>22. Jeremy Maclin, Phi</strong> - Maclin was inconsistent last year, but that's expected from a rooking joining a spread offense, with a better handle on the playbook this year he will shine</span>
    </div>

    <div>
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>23. Mike Wallace, Pit</strong> - Wallace's value will be lower with Big Ben out, but once Roethlisberger is back Wallace will be a top 15 WR</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>24. Mike Sims-Walker, Jac</strong> - His numbers last season were good overall, but he scored 4 or less fantasy points in 8 games last year</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>25. Dwayne Bowe, KC</strong> - If he's committed this year he can be great, if not then he'll end up with 589 yards again</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>26. Vincent Jackson, SD</strong> - He'll miss the first 3 weeks and maybe more, but he had 6 100 yards games last year</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>27. Donald Driver, GB</strong> -  The "he's old" talk started last year and Driver responded with his usual  70 catch 1,000 yard season</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>28. Percy Harvin, Min</strong> - Harvin's migraines worry me a little bit, but he's a spectacular talent that should see some time in the backfield as well</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <div id="_mcePaste">
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>29. Malcom Floyd, SD</strong> - Vincent Jackson's suspension is great for Floyd who will get a lot of time with Rivers in the first 3 weeks of the season.</span>
    </div>

    <div>
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>30. Johnny Knox, Chi</strong> - Knox will be playing split end in a Mike Martz offense</span>
    </div>

    <div>
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>31. Terrell Owens, Cin</strong> - The hate on Owens has gone too far, his QBs were atrocious last year and he still managed 829 yards</span>
    </div>

    <div>
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>32. Kenny Britt, Ten</strong> - Vince Young has to throw to someone and Britt will be that guy</span>
    </div>

    <div id="_mcePaste">
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>33. Derrick Mason, Bal</strong> - Mason won't get you 100 yards in many games, but he'll consistently get you 4 catches and 60 yards every week</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>34. Early Doucet, Ari</strong> - Doucet will take over Boldin's spot in the offense this year and be the #2 WR in Arizona</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>35. Devin Aromashodu, Chi</strong> - Once he got in the lineup he was Jay Cutler's favorite target</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>36. Mohamed Massaquoi, Cle</strong> - Massaquoi had the 3rd highest yards per catch last year with terrible QB play</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>37. T.J. Houshmandzadeh, Sea</strong> - The running game is weak and Matt Hasselbeck is continuing to decline, Housh is great in PPR leagues though</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>38. Robert Meachem, NO<span style="font-weight: normal;"> - Meachem will work off of his strong second half last year when he proved his status as a former #1 pick</span></strong></span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>39. Braylon Edwards, NYJ</strong> - If you got bonus points for drops he'd be the #1 fantasy receiver</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <div id="_mcePaste">
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>40. Steve Breaston, Ari</strong> - After 3 100 yards games in 2008 Breaston only had 3 games with more than 77 yards last year</span>
    </div>

    <div id="_mcePaste">
      <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>41. Santonio Holmes, NYJ</strong> - Holmes is ranked this low based on his inability to make smart decisions</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>42. Bernard Berrian, Min</strong> - Berrian had an injured hamstring all year last year, being healthy will help him this year</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>43. Santana Moss, Was</strong> - He had 1 100 yard game last year and without any legitimate #2 WR on the roster expect a lot more bust weeks this year for Moss.</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>44. Jerricho Cotchery, NYJ</strong> - The ability is there it just hasn't translated well onto the field lately</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>45. Lee Evans, Buf</strong> - Someone has to catch passes when the Bills are down 40-0 every week</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>46. Dez Bryant, Dal</strong> - I wanted to rank him higher, but I just don't see it this year. There are too many options on the Cowboys offense</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>47. Chaz Schilens, Oak</strong> - If he's healthy he's worth of a bench spot, if not he's unownable</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>48. Josh Cribbs, Cle</strong> - In terms of fantasy points as a WR Cribbs will probably rank 70th or lower, but factor in his QB and RB play and he could be worthy of a flex spot some weeks</span>
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>49. Jacoby Jones, Hou</strong> - Jones will take over as the start opposite Andre 3000, he averaged 16.2 yards per catch last year</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>50. Sammie Stroughter, TB</strong> - Someone will step up in Tampa Bay this season and I don't think it will be Mike Williams or Arrelious Benn.</span>
  </div>
</div>
