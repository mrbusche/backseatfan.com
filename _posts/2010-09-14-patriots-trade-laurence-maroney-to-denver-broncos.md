<div class="entry">
  <p>
    The New England Patriots have traded former first round pick Laurence Maroney to the Denver Broncos in exchange for Denver's fourth-round pick in 2011. In addition Denver gets New England's sixth-round pick in 2011.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Patriots selected Maroney with the 21st overall pick in the 2006 NFL Draft. 2006 was a big year for running backs with DeAngelo Williams, Joseph Addai, LenDale White, Maurice Jones-Drew, Jerious Norwood, Leon Washington, and Jerome Harrison all being selected after Maroney.

  <p>
    This is one of the few first round picks the Patriots have blown recently, if the Patriots had DeAngelo Williams or Joseph Addai, I don't think one or two super bowls that past 4 season would have been out of the question.`
