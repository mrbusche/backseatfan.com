    This is an audio clip fo Paul Allen calling the play of the Favre interception at the end of the 4th quarter. Anyone who has ever heard Paul Allen knows he loves the Vikings more than anyone could love anything and his reaction was just like many other Vikings fans. I don't think Allen is ripping Favre in the clip, I think he's ripping Childress for his poor play calling.

    Paul Allen - &#8220;Brett Favre goes back to pass he pumps, now he fires over the middle. Intercepted, I can't believe what I'm seeing right now. It was intercepted by Tracy Porter, near side to the 40 and John Sullivan runs him down at the 47 yard line. You've got to be kidding me, I can't believe what I just saw.&#8221;

    Other announcer - &#8220;Looking at that play he should have just held on to it Paul, he should've. He could've easily have gotten 5 or 6 yards if he would have just pulled that thing down and dove foreward.&#8221;

  <p>
    Paul Allen - &#8220;But why do you even ponder passing, I mean you can take a knee and try a 56 yard field goal. This is not Detroit man! This is the Super Bowl.&#8221;

    A video I found on youtube explains the whole thing perfectly.
