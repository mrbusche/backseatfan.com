<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Tiger woods will have a press conference Friday morning at 11 a.m. ET from the clubhouse at the TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, FL. What will he talk about? Probably apologize for what he did and hopefully announce that he will be back on the tour.
  </p>

  <p>
    TMZ says they have a source that links Tiger to coming back for Tavistock. But I am crossing my fingers that he is announcing he will be at the Phoenix Open next week. Probably not though.

    If you missed what happened, maybe you were in a coma, maybe you were in China, there is a good video timeline from ESPN above.

    Here is the Presser that the PGA put out:

      Tiger Woods will be speaking to a small group of friends, colleagues and close associates at 11 a.m. (EST) Friday at the TPC Sawgrass clubhouse in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.. Tiger plans to discuss his past and his future and he intends to apologize for his behavior.

      This will not be an open media event. However, it is understood that there are many media who are interested in what he has to say. In order to accommodate as best we can, we are working to arrange pool coverage of Tiger's remarks.

      There will be a network pool camera providing coverage of his talk. The feed will be available live to any network or station that wishes to air it. A limited number of print and wire service reporters will be in attendance and will share their notes, color and background on a pooled basis. We are working with the Golf Writers Association of America to arrange for pool coverage.
