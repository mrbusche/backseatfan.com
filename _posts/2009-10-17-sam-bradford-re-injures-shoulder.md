    <p>
      Oklahoma Sooners quarterback Sam Bradford has re-injured his right shoulder (throwing arm) against the Texas Longhorns. Bradford was taken down by Texas Longhorns cornerback Aaron Williams while trying to avoid a sack. This was only Oklahoma's second drive of the game.

    <p>
      Bradford first injured his shoulder just before halftime in the season opening loss vs BYU. His official injury was a Grade 3 sprain of the A-C joint. Bradford played his first game last week since his injury, and barely any of the game today.

      Lou Holtz - "Sam Bradford needs to learn how to fall, he needs to twist and land on his back"
    </p>

    <p>
      Sam Bradford needs to learn how to take a hit if he is going to do anything at the next level. He can't fall in his throwing arm, he should know this he has an insurance plan out. Good thing too, this injury could hurt his draft status. If only he went out last year maybe he could be on the Lion's IR by now.

    <p>
      Bradford will be out for the remainder of the game vs Texas, but maybe he will be back in a few weeks to show scouts what he is capable of. Not completing passes, but taking a hit without being injured.

      We will let you know what his official injury is when it comes out.
