  <p>
    In the Lions vs Bears game Calvin Johnson makes a great catch that is called a no catch because of the horrible rule that a player must have possession all the way to the ground. According to the rule, the call is correct, but the rule is terrible. Johnson obviously had possession and set the ball down after he had scored.

    The news gets worse for the Lions, not only did they lose this game, they also lost quarterback Matthew Stafford earlier in the game and he is expected to miss 2-6 weeks.
