    Not sure how many "restaurants" are open at 2:30 am, but I know that a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_call_%28bar_term%29#US_State_specific_laws"> few bars close about that time.</a> But lets give him a little benefit of the doubt, IHOP and Dennys are open that late, or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpOdCWaTsIk">buffet in Vegas</a>. Not really sure why this is huge news, I the only reason I am posting it is because all the news stations are reporting that it is restaurant and not bar. But technically if you serve chips, or wings, you are probably considered a restaurant. But there should be some sort of alcohol to food ratio here to figure out the correct term.

    Don't really know if he deserved the punch, maybe he said something. He does kind of look like a <a href="http://media.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/368417/941267.jpg">dude from the jersey shore</a>, so that might make someone want to punch him. But really people you should be punching Charlie Weis.
