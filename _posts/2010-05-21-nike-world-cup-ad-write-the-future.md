    This World Cup ad is Amazing. It is fast paced, entertaining, brings in different story-lines with each touch of the ball. The ad features Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Landon Donovan and Ronaldinho. I'm not sure if it makes me want to buy Nike, but it makes me want to watch the World Cup. Each segment could be broken down into their own commercial. And they have a few side commercials out as well. Nice work Nike.
