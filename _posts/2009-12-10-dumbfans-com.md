  <p>
    We are officially Launching <a href="http://www.dumbfans.com">DumbFans.com</a>!
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is dedicated to the funny fans that make us laugh.  Not all the fan's on there are dumb, there are a few studs out there.  But not many.  So send your picture in or links to your videos to <a href="mailto:dumbfans@gmail.com">dumbfans@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">

  </p>

  <p>
    All of us are dumb fans every now and then.  I know that I yell at the TV, because I'm pretty sure that it helps.  I just try not to be dumb in public.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once we get rolling we will start giving out prizes for the best submissions, but until we start getting traffic we can't really do that.  So tell your friends! Keep your eyes open and your camera's ready.  All of us are dumb fans, the smart ones just take the pictures.
