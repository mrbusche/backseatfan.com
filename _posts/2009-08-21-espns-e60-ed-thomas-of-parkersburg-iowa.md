    Here is a preview clip of an upcoming E:60 that we highly recommend.

    <strong>ESPN's<em> E:60</em> Revisits Parkersburg, Iowa, High School Sports Tragedy</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    ESPN's award-winning primetime newsmagazine<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/broadband/video/clip?id=null&categoryid=3060647" target="_blank"><em> E:60</em></a> will revisit the town of Parkersburg, Iowa, in the episode airing Tuesday, Aug. 25, at 7 p.m. ET. Parkersburg was the scene earlier this year when beloved high school football coach Ed Thomas was shot and killed by one of his former players, and the school is now preparing to launch its 2009 football campaign.

    <strong>Parkersburg</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The small town of Parkersburg, Iowa, was nearly destroyed by a tornado in 2008 and was rocked again on June 24, 2009, when beloved high school football coach Ed Thomas was shot to death in the school weight room by Mark Becker, one of his former players. Compounding the tragedy was the fact that the Thomas and Becker families had been friends for more than 30 years. In a town where high school football is king, Thomas had produced four current NFL players, and the community rallied around the coach after the tornado to get the school's football field ready for its opening game. ESPN reporter Steve Cyphers and<em> E:60</em>follow the story of a family and a community trying to deal with the loss of their leader, with the opening of the 2009 football season quickly approaching. The report includes exclusive interviews with members of the Thomas family, who speak about their loss, the power of their faith and the importance of embracing Scott Becker, Mark's younger brother, and a senior lineman on the team.

    We highly recommend watching the E:60 episode on Ed Thomas. <a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2009/06/a-p-coach-ed-thomas-dies-from-gunshot-wounds/">We featured an article on his tragic murder by one of his former players earlier this summer</a>. Both Matt and I have played against Coach Thomas and his team (lost both times), so the story is close to us. He was a great coach and a pillar in the community. I am sure that this E:60 will give him the praise and honor he deserves.
