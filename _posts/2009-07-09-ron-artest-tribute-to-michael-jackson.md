    The video has since been copyright claimed on youTube but here is a new link<br /> <a href="http://www.thisis50.com/main/authorization/signUp?target=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thisis50.com%2Fprofiles%2Fblogs%2Fron-artest-michael-michael-mj">Ron Artest - Michael Michael</a> You can even download the song from this link! Thanks Ron Ron!

    In addition to this great song, Artest has also vowed to remember Michael Jackson on the court. His number with the Lakers will be 37, the number of weeks Thriller was at #1.

  <p>
    The n word is used profanely in this song, What will be the Lakers reaction to this? Will they come out and ask him to take it down? Apologize?

  <p>
    Good Luck LA.
