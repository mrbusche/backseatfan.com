  <p>
    There haven't been any new updates from the T.J. Houshmandzadeh camp but the receiver is still expected to make a decision today, according to a league source. Houshmandzadeh originally said he wanted to make a decision by Sunday night so this may be premature.

  <p>
    It was reported earlier that T.J. spent the night in Minneapolis but this rumor has since been debunked as it is confirmed he flew back to Los Angeles Sunday Evening.

    The final three suitors for Houshmandzadeh's services are the Vikings, Cincinnati and Seattle.
