    Expansion rumors are flying around the college football world. It has already been confirmed that Colorado is leaving the Big 12 for the Pac 10 and Nebraska is leaving the Big 12 to join the Big Ten.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Pac 10 is reportedly ready to extend invitations to 5 other Big 12 schools, Texas, Texas A&M, Texas Tech, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State.

  <p>
    Why is this all happening right now? One word.
  </p>

  <p>
    Money.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Big Ten Network has been a huge success, reports claim the Big Ten receives $.88 per subscriber, this amounted to $19.9 million for each member during the last fiscal year.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, under NCAA rules a conference must have 12 teams to have a conference championship game, the Big Ten only had 11 teams, meaning they couldn't have a conference championship game.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the more interesting questions is what happens to Kansas? Their football program is decent, but their basketball program is superb. Will they get left out in the cold if the Big 12 folds? I don't see Kansas being a good fit in the Big Ten for basketball because they actually like scoring points, unlike the 50-48 slugfests that happen in the Big Ten.
  </p>

  <p>
    It will be interesting to see how all this plays out, I expect the Big 12 to dissolve and the Pac 10 and Big Ten both will end up with 16 teams. Notre Dame will most likely remain on the outside looking in.
