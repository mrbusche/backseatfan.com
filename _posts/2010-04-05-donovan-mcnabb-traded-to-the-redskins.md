    This was quite the shocker. I read the headlines on <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/04/03/glazer-redskins-among-teams-to-inquire-about-mcnabb/">Pro Football Talk</a> last week that the Redskins inquired about McNabb. I thought to myself, why the hell would they do that, there is no chance in hell that they could get McNabb.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5055346">They Did</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philadelphia gets a 2nd rounder (37th overall) and a 3rd or 4th rounder in 2011 in return for McNabb.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Rams were offering a 2nd Rounder for McNabb, which I find perfectly fair. But the Eagles got greedy, and went for a 2nd round PLUS a 3rd or 4th rounder next year with the Redskins. Great move for the Redskins, terrible move for the Eagles.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Eagles traded McNabb IN THE DIVISION to the Redskins. Why would you ever trade your STARTING QB to a rival team, that you play TWICE a year?!?!
  </p>

  <p>
    Did they not pay attention to Favre and the Vikings last year? Favre beat the Packers THREE times last year. There was more fire when he played the Packers, because &#8220;He had something to prove&#8221;, although he wouldn't admit it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Eagles made the Redskins a contender for next year. They gave Washington the missing piece to their offense, a legit QB. Why would you ever give that to rival? I'm not saying that the Redskins are going to the Super Bowl, but they are going to make it a lot tougher for everyone else in their division.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe McNabb is a ticking time bomb, and is really terrible, and only the Eagles can see it. But I really don't think that is happening.
  </p>

  <p>
    McNabb has 11 years experience in the Eagles offense, he knows all the little quarks, and weaknesses. Wonder if that is any sort of advantage when they play the Eagles next year?
  </p>

  <p>
    The Eagles believe that Kolb is their future, but the future is pretty uncertain for the Eagles. They will have a hard enough time beating the Redskins next year. Who knows how the rest of the season will go.
  </p>

  <p>
    If was an Eagles fan, I would be so pissed off right now. Completely livid. There is no point in getting an extra 3rd round pick for all the heartache that an Eagles fan is going endure over next season, and possibly more seasons to come.
