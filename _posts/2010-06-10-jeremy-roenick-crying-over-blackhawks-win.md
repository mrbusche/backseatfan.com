    Jeremy Roenick was trying to be strong, and be a broadcaster, but he couldn't hold it all in. Roenick played for the Blackhawks, but said he couldn't get it done when he had the chance. He got a little emotional after Dan Patrick asks if he is going to be OK. Roenick has the still has the passion for his former team, that's always a good thing to see.
