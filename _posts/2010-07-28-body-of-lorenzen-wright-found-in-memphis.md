    Friends, family, and fans of Lorenzen Wright are grieving today after the former NBA player was found dead outside of Memphis, Tennessee. Wright had been missing for the past 10 days.

  <p>
    Curtis Wright, Lorenzen Wright's uncle told the Associate Press today that the police had contacted Lorenzen's father Wednesday afternoon with the news his son had died.

    The identity of the victim has not been confirmed by authorities but Wright's mother, Deborah Marion arrived on the scene Wednesday night. After crossing the crime scene tape she tried to talk to police officers but was told to move back.

    Visibly distraught Marion was seen running down the road toward the crime scene before being stopped by a police officer.

    Wright played 778 career NBA games for 5 franchises and last played in the 2008-2009 season with the Cleveland Cavaliers.
