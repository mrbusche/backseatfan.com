  <p>
    Albert Haynesworth has failed his conditioning test two days in a row and therefore has missed the last two practices. To pass the test Haynesworth has to run a 300 yard shuttle - back and forth 25 yards a time. He has to run the drill twice with a 3:30 break in between. The first shuttle must be ran in 70 seconds and the second one in 73 seconds.

    <a href="https://www.myfoxdc.com/dpp/sports/how-hard-is-albert-haynesworths-conditioning-test-073010">Fox 5's Lindsay Murphy</a> ran the first sprint in 68 seconds, but ran the second in 81 seconds.

    After hearing this news I jogged over to the nearest football field to see how difficult this was. I'm 6'2&#8243; 205 pounds, I would consider myself in decent shape, but definitely not superb shape. I ran the first drill in 62 seconds and the second in 66 seconds. If I had a video camera that wasn't on my phone I would record this. Can I race Haynesworth for his contract?<br />
