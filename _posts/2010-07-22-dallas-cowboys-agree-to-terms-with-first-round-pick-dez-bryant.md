    According to ESPN's <a href="http://twitter.com/Adam_Schefter/statuses/19291029648">Adam Schefter</a> Dez Bryant has agreed to a five-year $11.8 million deal that includes $8.5 million guaranteed. Bryant is the first <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2010/06/2010-nfl-draft-first-round-pick-rookie-signing-status/">1st round pick</a> to agree to terms. According to <a href="http://twitter.com/adbrandt/status/19293909427">Andrew Brandt</a> of the National Football Post, the deal has no 2nd year option bonus, the guaranteed money is all in form of signing bonus.

    Bryant, who dropped to 24th overall because of character issues, made it clear to his agent, Eugene Parker, that it was important for him to report to camp on time. Even though he said that, out of all the first round picks I would have expected Bryant to pull a Michael Crabtree based on where he should have been drafted.

    Bryant, surprisingly worked out a contract before first overall pick Sam Bradford. Expect Bryant to have a big impact on the Cowboys offense this season, he shouldn't have any issues beating out Roy Williams for the starting WR spot opposite Miles Austin.

    Looking at the data from the <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2009/05/2009-nfl-draft-rookie-signing-status/">2009 Draft</a> Bryant signed a significantly smaller overall deal than last year's 24th overall pick Peria Jerry, who signed a 5 year, $13.25M deal, but Bryant received nearly $1 million more in guaranteed money than Jerry ($7.55M).

    In case you've forgotten what a freakish athlete Bryant is check out the video before. I'd recommend putting your volume on mute though.
