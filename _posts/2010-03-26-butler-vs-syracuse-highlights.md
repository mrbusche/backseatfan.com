    <br /> NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen Butler vs Syracuse Highlights
  </p>

  <p>
    #5 Butler upsets #1 Syracuse and reach the Elite 8 with a final score of 63-59. I don't think anyone saw this coming, I was reading all the prediction and they considered Syracuse a lock. Syracuse was dealing with some injuries, but they were still the favorite by far. Great job by Butler, it's a mid majors tournament this year.
