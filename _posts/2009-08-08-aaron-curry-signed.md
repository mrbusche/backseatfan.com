  <p>
    According to <a href="https://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlesports/archives/175824.asp">SeattlePi.com</a> Aaron Curry has signed a multiyear contract. The terms of the contract are<a href="https://backseatfan.com">6 years $60M $34M G</a>. He joined his team about a half hour into practice. So far he has missed 8 days of practice with the Seattle Seahawks. In the original article it was said that as fan's cheered him on as he ran on the field, but one fan wasn't quite so kind, shouting "It's about time,". Which I don't find unkind, I just find him shouting the truth, every draft pick should be signed by now. It is ridiculous if they are not.
