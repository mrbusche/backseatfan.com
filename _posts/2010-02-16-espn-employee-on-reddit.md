<div class="entry">
  <p>
    I stumbled across this yesterday on reddit, and I found it kind of interesting. Reddit is kind of like digg, but it doesn't always have to be stories. I don't use it that often, but feel free to reddit us or digg us :).

    An Employee from ESPN decided to do a tell all on reddit, and it is pretty funny. Follow the link,<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b1s9a/i_work_for_espn_ama/">I work for ESPN AMA</a>.

    In short, he talks a lot about different employees and he can do this, because reddit is pretty much anonymous. Wonder if it is on the list of social networking sites that ESPN employees can't go on. I'm sure maybe he divulged to much information, and will get fired shortly, then probably will write a book.
