    Butler High School had one of those lateral it back desperation type of kick returns with only 1.8 seconds left in the game (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNsqpIfzeAQ">Cal- Standford</a> minus the band on the field). They pulled it off, plus made a two point conversion to stun Pleasure Ridge Park 42-41.
