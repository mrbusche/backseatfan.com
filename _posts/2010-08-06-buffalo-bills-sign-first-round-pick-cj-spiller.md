    The Buffalo Bills signed there 1st round pick CJ Spiller.
  </p>

  <p>
    Spiller signed for a 5 year 26.5 M $15.954M Guaranteed contract with the Bills.  This is actually a smaller contract than last years 9th overall pick BJ Raji.  No wonder he was holding out, he was trying to get a fair contract and didn't even get the annual increase.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 9th overall pick out of Rutgers should make a big impact with the Bills this season.  Expect Spiller to take over for Marshawn Lynch as the 2nd RB for the Bills.  The Bills will use the two headed running back monster between Fred Jackson and CJ Spiller, with Jackson getting the majority of the carries for now.
