      There have been a lot of changes to the program over the past couple years.  It all started when Woody Johnson bought the Jets back in 2000.  Now they have a new coach, a new stadium, a new 120,000-square-foot complex and the Jets are a winning team. Can we attribute their success to the fact that they are a great employer?  Maybe.  It worked for a lot of top tech companies.  (see Google, Zappos, Microsoft)

      Alright, well most of the credit goes to the team.  But  employees see the team, they interact with the team, they have some influence on the players' day to day activities.  The Jets have the workplace figured out, now all they need to do is keep their players out of troulbe and maybe they can go to another Super Bowl.
