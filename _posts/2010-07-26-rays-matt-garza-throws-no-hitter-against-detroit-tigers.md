    Tampa Bay Rays P Matt Garza has thrown a no hitter against the Detroit Tigers. Garza walked one batter, but still faced the minimum in the 5-0 victory. Opposing starter Max Scherzer had a no hitter through 5 2/3 innings before giving up a grand slam for his first hit.

    Right fielder Ben Zobrist Â made a great catch to save the no hitter in the 3rd inning. Zobrist, who is known as one of the most versatile defenders in the majors needed every inch of his 6'4&#8243; frame to pull the quick liner from Danny Worth in.

    In the 3rd inning Tigers skipper Jim Leyland was tossed after a terrible call on a stolen base by BJ Upton.

    Max Scherzer pitched well the first 5 innings, but the wheels started to come in the 6th. After a walk to Zobrist, Carl Crawford reached first on a catcher's interference and then Scherzer walked Evan Longoria. Scherzer struck out Pena for the 2nd out in the inning, but then gave up a grand slam to Matt Joyce, which was more than enough offense for Garza who needed 120 pitches to toss the no-no.
