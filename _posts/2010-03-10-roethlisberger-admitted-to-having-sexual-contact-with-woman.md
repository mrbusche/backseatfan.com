    Ben Roethlisberger has a little explaining to do. This is a nice <a href="http://kdka.com/video/?id=70082@kdka.dayport.com">video explaining it all</a>,  but heres the sum of it.
  </p>

    He said he didn't have sex with young woman, but there was sexual contact that was not consented.  Not sure what he did, but she "slipped" and fell afterwards.  So outlook not good for Big Ben.

    What are you thinking Ben?  Seriously? "Oh lets go into the bathroom with some random girl in a bar and try to get some".  Terrible idea.  You are one of the highest paid players in the NFL, stop going after 20 year old college girls.  Didn't you learn anything from all this Tiger Woods media the past few months?  Sure you aren't married, but maybe don't go out to bars and go after drunk college girls at 2 am.
