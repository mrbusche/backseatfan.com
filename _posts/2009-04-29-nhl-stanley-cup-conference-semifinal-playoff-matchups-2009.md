    The Sharks losing to the Ducks kept us from going a perfect 8 for 8 in the Quarterfinals. Here are our conference semifinal picks
  </p>

  <h2>
    Eastern Conference
  </h2>

  <p>
    <strong>1 Boston Bruins vs 6 Carolina Hurricanes</strong> - Boston dominated their first round series and will have 8 days off before their first game against the Hurricanes. Tim Thomas was great in the first round series and he will continue to be great. Cam Ward was off and on against the Devils in goal but the 'Canes were lucky to get by the Devils in the Quarterfinals. <strong>Bruins win in 6</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>2 Washington Capitals vs 4 Pittsburgh Penguins</strong> - The Capitals struggled in their first round series and won mainly because Henrik Lundqvist forgot how to play goalie in games 5 and 6. With that being said Alex Ovechkin absolutely owns Sidney Crosby and I don't think this series will be much different although Marc-Andre Fleury and Evgeni Malkin will do their best to keep this a series. <strong>Capitals win in 7</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>
    Western Conference
  </h2>

  <p>
    <strong> 2 Detroit Red Wings vs 8 Anaheim Ducks</strong> - Just like the Bruins the Red Wings breezed through their first round series and will a week off before playing the Ducks who are coming off a grueling 7 game series against the San Jose Sharks. 36 year old Chris Osgood was magnificent the first 3 games of the Columbus series and I don't think this series will be much different. <strong>Red Wings win in 6</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>3 Vancouver Canucks vs 4 Chicago Blackhawks</strong> - The Canucks also swept their first round series and will have 8 days off just like the Bruins. Roberto Luongo was lights out as usual but the Canucks struggled to score and the series was much closer than you would think seeing it was a sweep. The Blackhawks took 6 games to get past the Flames but I think they learned a lot about themselves in that series. Nikolai Khabibulin had two atrocious games in which the 'Hawks lost and I don't think a veteran goalie like himself will have another game like that. I can't remember the last time this happened, but the Blackhawks will advance to the Conference Finals. <strong>Blackhawks in 6</strong>
