    Door still open? Brett seems to always give himself some leeway, just in case he gets that itch again. Bus Cook says the door is &#8220;probably shut&#8221;. So hopefully for everyone's sanity, and the Vikings players and fans, it is shut. Unless there is an injury or two, I don't want to see that door reopen.
