  <p style="text-align: left;">
    I am glad to see that Drew Brees is on the cover of 2011.  The Saints 2010 season is now over, and they can prepare for the 2011 season. I guess I am just happy it wasn't Jared Allen.

    The Madden Curse is real, and Drew Brees will have a down season.  Only a few people escaped the Madden curse, so believe in the statistics people.

    The first game of the NFL season is Saints vs Vikings, expect things to happen then.  I think the Vikings want payback.
