    Fan's burned LeBron James Jerseys last night after learning that he wasn't staying with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Anyone who doesn't want their LeBron stuff send it my way! Those Jerseys are going to be classic throwbacks!

    You had to know he wasn't going to stay in Cleveland. Once all the top free agents were gone he didn't really have a choice. Don't be bitter. Just hope that the Browns can get to the playoffs in the next 10 years. Look on the bright side, at least you have a good college football team in the state.

    Oh and if you don't want to send the jerseys out, still don't burn them. Send them to Goodwill or a shelter.
