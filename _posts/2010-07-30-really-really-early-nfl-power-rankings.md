  <p>
    The are our Really Really Early Preseason NFL Power Rankings. Argue all you want, we haven't even watch a snap yet, so bare with us. We will update them again after the preseason, then do our weekly rankings as usual. Vikings for the win!

        <strong>Minnesota Vikings (12-4)</strong><br /> Maybe it is blatant homerism, maybe it is the truth.  But as of right now I like the Vikings to win the Super Bowl.  I know Favre is coming back for sure, so I'm not even worried about it. They arguably have one of the best defenses in the league, and one of the best offenses out there. Championship.

        <strong>Baltimore Ravens (9-7)<br /> </strong>Flacco now has a great WR to throw to, so expect a well balanced offense.  The defense is getting long in the tooth, but they are still one of the best in the league. Expect big things from the Ravens this season.

        <strong>New Orleans Saints (13-3)</strong><br /> They are the team to beat this year.  I don't see a super bowl repeat for the Saints, I think they will come down off their high and fall somewhat hard.  Too early to tell, but I could see them barely making the playoffs.

        <strong>Indianapolis Colts (14-2)</strong><br /> Payton Manning is still on the team isn't he?  The Colts will be just as good this year, especially with all of their wide outs healthy. Plus they have another Iowa Hawkeye on their defense, so that should help.

        <strong>Green Bay Packers (11-5)</strong><br /> Aaron Rodgers is getting an offensive line, this could be scary. Ryan  Grant had 1200 yards and 11 TDs last year, Rodgers had 30 passing TDs last year.  The Packers offense is going to be good, plus they have a top 10 defense.  Toss up between the Vikings and the Packers for NFC championship.  Whoever wants it more.

        <strong>New England Patriots (10-6)</strong><br /> Wes Welker is the key to this team. Welker moves the chains, he is pretty much the Patriots RB.   If he can be healthy by midseason then the Patriots will be a contender.  Don't get me wrong, they will be good without him, but not great.

      <td width="486">
        <strong>Miami Dolphins (7-9)</strong><br /> The Dolphins had a great offseason, grabbing one of the best WRs in the game in Brandon Marshall, a solid LB in Karlos Dansby, and a few good picks in the draft. I expect the Dolphins to be on top of their divison this season.  Sorry Jets, Henne > Sanchez.

      <td width="486">
        <strong>Dallas Cowboys (11-5)</strong><br /> As much as I dislike the Cowboys, I have to admit they look like they are on track to make a run for it this year.  Dez Bryant should be an impact rookie this year, he should beat out terrible Roy Williams for the #2 WR role. Felix Jones will become the starting RB, and the Cowboys should have their offense rolling? But what about their defense?

      </td>

      <td width="486">
        <strong>New York Jets (9-7)</strong><br /> I am not sure that adding an old LT is better than keeping an old Thomas Jones.  They were both going to be backups to Shonn Greene, but Thomas Jones at least doesn't have an injured toe that is holding him back.  The defense will be solid, but the question is Mark Sanchez at QB.  He did good last year, but can he keep it up?

      </td>

      <td width="486">
        <strong>Cincinnati Bengals (10-6)</strong><br /> The addition of T.O. makes the Bengals a little better.  TO isn't the same player he used to be, but he can still go vertical.  As long as it takes some of the attention of of Chad Ochocinco it is a good thing.  Ocho needs a solid #2 to be most effective, and TO should be able to fill that void.

      <td width="486">
        <strong>Tennessee Titans (8-8)</strong><br /> Vince Young played well last year, and with the best RB in the league they have a chance to make a run.  Weak point is WRs since there is pretty much no one to throw to.  Maybe Young and Johnson be running the triple option this year.

      <td width="486">
        <strong>San Diego Chargers (13-3)</strong><br /> Almost anyone could win this division this year, and the Chargers are just here because the Broncos are going to test out Tebow, the Raiders are the Raiders, the the Chiefs aren't quite there yet, although they could surprise us. It is an open race, but Norv Turner is still the coach, so he will somehow screw it up.

        <strong>Atlanta Falcons (9-7)</strong><br /> The Falcons are going to be good this year.  They have all the right components, and I think they have a good chance of winning the division.  I put the Saints up top since they won the Super Bowl, but it is a lot closer division than it looks on these power rankings.

        <strong>Arizona Cardinals (10-6)</strong><br /> Warner is gone, can Leinart pick up the slack?  The loss of Boldin is also there, but they can reload at WR.  It is a little harder to replace a future hall of fame QB from the great University of Northern Iowa (Go Panthers!).  There is also a LB role to fill with Dansby gone, another pair of shoes that are hard to fill.

        <strong>Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)</strong><br /> Big Ben is out for at least 4 games, that is 4 possible losses.  They lost Santonio Holmes, who was a key piece to the receiving core.  The Steelers still have a terrible offensive line, so expect Big Ben to get another concussion and sexually assault another girl. I expect them to compete, they just aren't going to come out on top in there conference.

        <strong>Jacksonville Jaguars (7-9)</strong><br /> Not drafting Tim Tebow was probably the best things that happened to the Jaguars.  The owner loved him, and they should be happy they don't have to deal with having a terrible Quarterback.  They didn't make any major moves in the offseason to improve.  They will be a fierce competitor, but don't be surprised when they are in last place in their division, hovering around .500

        <strong>Denver Broncos (8-8)</strong><br /> What game will the Tim Tebow show begin? My prediction is about game 8. Woody Paige thinks it will be the game opener. With a $33M max contract I would leave him on the bench just to save money. The Broncos lost one of the best receivers in the NFL, and replaced him with a bunch of rookie wide outs.  Good idea right?  Expect the starter to be whoever can make the quick short throws, because that is the only threat they will have with  Brandon Marshall gone.

        <strong>Kansas City Chiefs (4-12)<br /> <span style="font-weight: normal;">Does reuniting a bunch of former Patriot coaches and GM make a team better?  Maybe. The Chiefs are a young team and could do surprisingly good this year. They are in a terrible division, and anyone could come out on top. If they can get all the players on board to run their system, then they could be very successful.</span> </strong>
