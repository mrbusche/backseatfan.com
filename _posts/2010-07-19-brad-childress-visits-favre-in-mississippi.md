  <p>
    Minnesota Vikings Head Coach Brad Childress is in Hattiesburg, Mississippi today, apparently trying to find out if he still has a QB.  Childress arrived in Hattiesburg Sunday night and said he did not know how long he would stay in Mississippi.
  </p>

  <p>
    Childress and Brett Favre were both seen Monday at The University of Southern Mississippi's 7-on-7 passing camp for area high school athletes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Childress said he wouldn't comment about the visit, but he said  &#8220;You can fill in the blanks.&#8221;
  </p>

  <p>
    So I will attempt to fill in the blanks.
  </p>

  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <strong>Favre is&#8230;______.</strong>
  </p>

  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
    a.) Coming Back.<br /> b.) Going to Retire.<br /> c.)  Waiting until training camp is almost over, then he will come back.<br /> d.)  Still unsure if he is coming back
  </p>

  <p>
    (For those of you who don't know&#8230; The answer is C.  It is always C. )
  </p>

  <p>
    There is no way Favre is going to &#8220;make up his mind&#8221; before training camp starts.  Even when it starts, he is going to milk his injury until the season starts.  Oh, and Childress already knew that he was coming back, this is all for show.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although Favre has said that he still hasn't made up his mind on whether he will come back and play another season, we all know what the answer is.
