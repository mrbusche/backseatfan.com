    Bryant, is an All-American who is listed ninth overall on Mel Kiper Jr.'s Big Board, was ruled ineligible by the school because he failed to fully disclose his interaction with a former NFL player to the NCAA.

    Bryant will apply forreinstatementby the NCAA but it is a long process. Bryant did not play last weekend against Grambling State.

  <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">
    The school released the following statement by Dez Bryant, &#8220;I made a mistake by not being entirely truthful when meeting with the NCAA. I sincerely regret my mistake and apologize to my teammates, coaches, OSU fans and the NCAA.&#8221;
  </p>

  <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">
    The bylaw Bryant apparently violated was 10.1, which states,&#8220;Knowingly furnishing the NCAA or the individual's institution false or misleading information concerning the individual's involvement in or knowledge of matters relevant to a possible violation of an NCAA regulation.&#8221;
  </p>

  <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.8em;">
    This is a crushing blow to OSU's already slim title hopes, Oklahoma State could easily lose 3 more games this season against Missouri, Texas, and Oklahoma.
