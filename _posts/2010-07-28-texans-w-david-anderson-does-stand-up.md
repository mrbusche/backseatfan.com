  <p>
    Houston Texans WR  David Anderson does stand up at Houston Dynamo's Bobby Boswell's Party. He has a lot of time to spend on stand up since he never plays?  But he actually pretty good.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>NSFW language</strong><br /> <br /> Anderson takes some shots at the University of Phoenix, Owen Daniels, Fantasy Football, and Houston Dynamo.  Eventually he will start playing and his stand up career will die, or he will never play and his stand up career will take off.  Either way he is a winner.
