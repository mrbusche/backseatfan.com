    Another crazy spiderman like baseball catch happened in a Hiroshima Carp game. This time it was center fielder Amaya Soichiro that climbed up the wall and made the grab. I don't think its better than Masato Akamatsu's catch, but it is right up there with it. When are these Japanese league players going to come to the MLB?!
