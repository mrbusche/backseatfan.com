  <p>
    Up until today I thought of LaVar Arrington as a guy who was great in college and mediocre in the pros, but after listening to his rant from his radio show I have a newfound respect for him.

  <p>
    Clinton Portis recently told the NFL Network that Arrington left the Redskins, "because he felt like the main money guy."

  <p>
    Arrington has a good rant in response.

    Wait a few minutes, it gets pretty good.
