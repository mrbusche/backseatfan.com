    Nice highlight reel of Allen Iverson playing <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Basketball</span> Football. Apparently he was better than Mike Vick in high school. Too bad he played basketball he would have been awsome to watch. He also holds the state record for INTS in a game, with 7. Pretty Crazy.
