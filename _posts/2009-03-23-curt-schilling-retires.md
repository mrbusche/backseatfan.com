    â€œTurn out the lights the party's overâ€ â€¦

    Those were the words written on Curt Schilling's blog just a few moments ago. Schilling pitched for five teams in his big league career, Baltimore Orioles, Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, Arizona Diamondbacks and Boston Red Sox. The ace will most famously be known for his bloody sock in the 2004 world series and his always available opinion. You may not have always agreed with what he had to say, but that didn't stop the 42-year old than speaking his mind throughout his 20 year big league career.

  <p>
    Six All-Star games and three world series titles in four attempts, Schilling points out there are many men in Cooperstown who have never experienced a World Series title. Schilling went 11-2 in 19 career postseason starts with a 2.23 ERA. Schilling won his first World Series title in 2001 with the Diamondsbacks and followed it up with titles in 2004 and 2007 with the Red Sox. Curt also pitched for the Phillies who won the pennant in 1993. He was the only pitcher to win a World Series start for three different teams.

  <p>
    Schilling last pitched in game 2 of the 2007 World Series, a win for the Boston Red Sox. Shoulder issues prevented Curt from pitching even one inning in 2008. Schilling is 15th all time with 3,116 strikeouts, he had a career ERA of 3.46 and compiled a career record of 216-146.

    Schilling famously said he was coming to Boston to help snap an 86-year World Series drought and he backed his words up by playing a crucial role in the Red Sox title year of 2004. You may not always agree with what Schilling has to say but you can't argue with his talent and his big game pitching abilities. Is he is a future Hall of Famer? I think he will eventually get in but probably not on the first 2 or 3 ballots after he is eligible.
