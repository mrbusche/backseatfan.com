  <p>
    To no one's surprise the Oregon Ducks are revealing new uniforms for their BCS national championship game January 10, 2011. None of the individual components are actually new, but this will be the 13th different uniform combination the Ducks have used in their 13 games this season. I've always been a fan of the Oregon uniforms, although there are a lot of critics out there.<br /> <a href="/images/2010/12/oregonBCS.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9324" title="oregonBCS" src="/images/2010/12/oregonBCS.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="582" /></a>
