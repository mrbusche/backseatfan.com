    If you don't hate LeBron James, here is your chance. LeBron James runs a summer camp for kids called the King's Academy, he teaches the kids basketball. So here is a video of LeBron schooling the kids on the court. The action starts at about 1:30 seconds in and he dunks on a 6 year old about a minute later. Yes, you read that right, I am surprised the kid didn't goto the ground and start crying. Well, he might have started crying, but Nike took the footage away, so we will never know.

    So all of you LeBron haters out there? Keep on hating.  You aren't supposed to try  to win when you are playing a 6 year old.  You are supposed to let them score, get their confidence up.  Let the games be competitive.  You aren't supposed to school them and do a ally-oop to yourself and dunk over them. LeBron obviously hasn't figured that one out. You don't see dads dunking on their sons at the age of 6 in the driveway. Well at least mine didn't.

    It would be pretty cool if you were one of those kids playing with LeBron James, or an adult for that matter.  But look at the bright side, at least he wasn't blocking the kids shots left and right.
