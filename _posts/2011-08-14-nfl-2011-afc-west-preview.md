    The AFC West features one thing this year, two good teams and two not-so-good teams.<br /> San Diego and Kansas City will once again battle for the division while Oakland and Denver will battle for the cellar.<br /> So, here’s how I have the season playing out:
  </p>

  <p>
    SAN DIEGO — The Chargers and Philip Rivers didn’t win the West last year, but that won’t be the case this year.<br /> I think they made a few good under-the-radar moves in nabbing Bob Sanders (if he plays in one full game it will be a win) and adding Takeo Spikes.<br /> I think the big signing was keeping Malcom Floyd. Yes, Vincent Jackson is back for a full season but adding Floyd gives Rivers three legit pass-catchers along with Antonio Gates (if he is healthy).<br /> So, the Chargers will air it out and should have a solid ground game with Mike Tolbert and Ryan Mathews toting the rock. If they can’t put up big numbers against other teams, they can always look forward to getting a couple hundred yards against the Broncos.<br /> The defense might not be the best but the offense is going to take them as far as they go.<br /> Fantasy player I love: Mathews, injuries were a downer in his rookie year but I think this is the year he breaks out. He played behind Tolbert in the preseason opener but maybe that was a “figure it out” move by the coaches to him. I’m saying over 1,000 rush yards and double-digit TDs, unless of course, he gets injured.
  </p>

  <p>
    KANSAS CITY — Remember that time the Chiefs traded for a quarterback and he didn’t play very good the first year and then blew up (in a good way) the next?<br /> That’s what Matt Cassel did, coming off a 16:16 TD:INT all the way to 27:7 last year.<br /> He was helped by the emergence of Dwayne Bowe in his ? fourth year. The always important third-year breakout waited a year for him.<br /> Bowe was a freak last with 15 TD grabs and what did the Chiefs do? They went out and got Steve Breaston (solid underneath guy) and Jonathan Baldwin who is sort of in a Bowe mold.<br /> This is all paired together with the explosive Jamaal Charles in the running game.<br /> Not only will the Chiefs be exciting on offense but the defense is young and Eric Berry is an Ed Reed type in the defensive backfield.<br /> Fantasy player I love: They actually have about four that I like very much but I think Baldwin has the most sleeper potential. Obviously Bowe and Charles are near the top at their positions but I think Baldwin’s size/catching ability sets him apart. I’ll go low since he’s a rookie at 700/7.

  <p>
    DENVER — Kyle Orton or Tim Tebow? Tebow or Orton? Einhorn and Finkel?<br /> Until the starter is named the debate will rage on for Tebow or Orton as the Broncos starting QB.<br /> I don’t think they’ll go wrong either way although the loss of Demaryius Thomas until later in the season is a blow most people don’t see.<br /> Would he have made them contend for the West? No. But he would have been a big target for either QB. Now they will roll with Brandon Lloyd, Eddie Royal and Eric Decker. Not the best.<br /> All offseason I’ve been reading how the coaches didn’t think Knowshon Moreno was an every-down back so what do they do, sign Willis McGahee. I like the move to add another pretty proven back who has something left but that doesn’t make them a contender.<br /> What will make them move up to third in the West is the defense. Most notably the addition of linebacker Von Miller. That dude is a freak and should help shore up a porous run defense. They will definitely top last year’s 4-12 record.<br /> Fantasy player I love: Ehhhh, I know Lloyd was pretty awesome last year but if Tebow is the starter I go with him. The guy should put up decent passing numbers to go with the valuable rushing numbers and TDs.
  </p>

  <p>
    OAKLAND — What do you do the year after one of your best records in years? Fire your head coach, obviously.<br /> Not just that though, then you lose two key players to that same fired coach to his new team, Seattle.<br /> The Raiders offense might have been decent with keeping Robert Gallery and Zach Miller but I don’t think adding Kevin Boss to replace Miller is going to get it done.<br /> As always, the defense should be solid but unless the Darren McFadden/Michael Bush train is going every game and Darrius Heyward-Bey can catch the occasional pass, the Raiders will struggle to reach last year’s 8-8 mark.<br /> Fantasy player I love: McFadden of course. I drafted him his first year and have held him ever since. Luckily he finally played and paid off last year. As always, injuries make or break his year. I still can’t figure out if Bush back will help/hurt him though.

    So, there you have it. That’s how I think the West will go. I do think the Chargers and Chiefs will be as close as it was last year but with it being 11-5, 10-6 and not 10-6, 9-7.
