<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Colorado Rockies closer Huston Street was struck in the right pelvic area by a line drive in batting practice and has been taken off the field in an ambulance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rockies trainer Keith Dugger said that Street passed out two or three times after he was hit by a line drive from Ian Stewart. Street has been taken to a local emergency room to undergo further evaulation.

  <p>
    Manuel Corpas will likely fill in at closer during Street's absence, which according to early reports could be a while.
