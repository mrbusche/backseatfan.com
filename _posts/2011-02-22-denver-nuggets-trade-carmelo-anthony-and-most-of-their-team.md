    The Denver Nuggets traded their 32-25 team for the New York Knicks 28-26 team (minus Stoudemire).  Plus the Timberwolves slipped a trade in there.  This is one massive trade that went down. Here is the breakdown between the three way trade Between Nuggets, Timberwolves, and Knicks: <strong><br /> </strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Knicks:</strong> New York Knicks receive Carmelo Anthony,  Chauncey Billups, Anthony Carter, Shelden Williams and Renaldo Balkman from the Nuggets, and the Knicks also receive Corey Brewer from the Timberwovles
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Nuggets:</strong> Denver Nuggets will receive Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov, a 2014 first-round draft pick, and he Warriors' 2012 second-round pick, the Warriors' 2013 second-round pick and $3 million in cash from the New York Knicks.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Timberwolves:</strong> Minnesota Timberwolves receive Eddy Curry and Anthony Randolph from the New York Knicks
  </p>

  <p>
    Hard to say who came out on top, the Knicks get a ticking time bomb, and the Nuggets get a few draft picks for the future (Plus the no longer have to deal with Melo).
  </p>

  <p>
    Nuggets win! Plus we no longer have to talk about Melo!
