    Ron Artest is on top of the world after winning game 7 of the NBA Finals. He could do anything, beat box, rap, pretty much anything but answer questions. He completely ignores what the interviewers are saying, and just answers the questions that are in his head.

    Ron Artest thanks his hood and his psychiatrist, for some reason I'm not sure he could do it without his psychiatrist.

    WHEATIES! He is actually really funny in this video too. He is so damn happy, and just doesn't care what people think of him.
