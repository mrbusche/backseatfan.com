  <p>
    The Atlanta Braves acquired a right handed power bat today, acquiring Dan Uggla from the division rival Florida Marlins for left handed reliever Mike Dunn and utility player Omar Infante.
  </p>

  <p>
    Uggla is a free agent after the 2011 season, but the Braves will most likely try to sign the second basemen to an extension. Uggla became the first 3nd basemen in big league history to have 30 home runs in 4 season.

  <p>
    Martin Prado will move to 3B full-time as Chipper Jones recovers from knee surgery and/or spends some time in left field if necessary, according to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Ken_Rosenthal/statuses/4665630624055296">Ken Rosenthal</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Tigers, Blue Jays and Cardinals were also suitors for Uggla, but it appears the super utility ability of Infante may have been the best the Marlins were offered. The first person to report the finalization of the deal was<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jcrasnick/statuses/4663337744867329"> ESPN's Jerry Crasnick</a>.
