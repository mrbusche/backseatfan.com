    ESPN's Adam Schefter is reporting that Titans have <a href="http://twitter.com/Adam_Schefter/statuses/20030509935">reached an agreement </a>with DE Derrick Morgan the 16th overall pick in this year's draft.
  </p>

  <p>
    This signing comes quickly after the 15th overall pick Jason Pierre-Paul <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2010/07/giants-sign-first-round-pick-de-jason-pierre-paul/">signed with the Giants</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Terms of the agreement have not yet been disclosed, but based on the picks before and after Morgan he should receive just over $19 million with around $11.2 million guaranteed.
  </p>

  <p>
    This signing leaves just 10 unsigned first round picks, that number is sure to decrease by a couple more tonight.
