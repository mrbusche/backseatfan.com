    I think the title says just about everything we can say here. David Huff took a line drive of his head which bounced into the outfield. Huff was taken to a hospital, where a CT scan was negative.

    The Indians said Huff never lost consciousness or experienced memory loss. He will remain at New York-Presbyterian Hospital for several hours as a precaution.
