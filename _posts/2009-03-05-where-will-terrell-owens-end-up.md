    Terrell Owens was cut by the Cowboys this morning so the question now is, Where will TO end up? Oakland, Denver, Washington, The Jets and The Giants are all teams I think will be interested in TO's services.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why Denver? Josh McDaniels did a great job of getting Randy Moss integrated with New England Patriots offense and I think he would do a good job of integrating him into the Denver offense. You didn't hear a bad word come out of Randy Moss's mouth once he got to New England, although I think some of that credit can be given to Bill Belicheck and Robert Kraft. The one issue I see here is the Broncos already have a problem wide receiver in Brandon Marshall and also have an up and coming WR in Eddie Royal. Owens would have to put his ego aside to play on this team.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why Washington? Dan Snyder loves to spend money on big name free agents and then watch them underperform as soon as they get to DC. Deion Sanders, Jason Taylor, Brandon Lloyd, Andre Carter, and Adam Archuleta are a few that come to mind. With the signings of Albert Haynesworth and DeAngelo Hall this offseason it is hard to imagine Snyder has enough money to sign Owens, but I think he will give it a shot.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why the Giants? The Plaxico Burress situation is up in the air and the Giants do not have a #1 WR on the roster. Steve Smith, Domenick Hixon, and Sinorice Moss are all decent receivers but none of them are a #1 WR. Tom Coughlin has done a good job of eliminating problems as they have arisen in New York and I think although they will show interest the Giants will not sign him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why the Jets? The departure of Laveranues Coles means the Jets are lacking a #1 WR and although he has shown flashes, Jerricho Cotchery is not yet a #1 receiver. The Jets also are up in the air with the QB situation and one thing that would help them a lot is a big play WR to help Kellen Clemens, Eric Ainge, or whoever else settle into the job. I think the Jets will be among the front runners for TO's services.<br /> Why Oakland? Al Davis has done a great job of picking up players, especially WRs, with a history of trouble, and not doing anything with them. Randy Moss and Javon Walker are two examples that come to mind. Although TO is getting older and is still without a ring, I don't think that will affect his decision, I can't picture Owens going anywhere other than Oakland. Al Davis will throw as much money at Owens as he wants (see Nnamdi Asomugha) and owens will be catching passes in black and silver in 2009.

    Owens is the biggest name free agent left in the WR class with only Marvin Harrison, Lance Moore, DJ Hackett, Joey Galloway, Jerry Porter and Drew Bennett left as notable players.
