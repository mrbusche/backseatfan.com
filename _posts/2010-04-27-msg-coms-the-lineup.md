  <p>
    <strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">“The Lineup: New York’s All-Time Best Baseball Players,”</span></strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;"> is a new original series and interactive fantasy game that will determine the best baseball players in the history of New York. </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">They are  30-minute episodes that present a number of nominees for consideration at each position, from the Yankees, Mets, New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers, with one episode dedicated to the best New York manager of all-time. </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">MSG’s Fran Healy hosts a panel consisting of Hall of Fame Mets catcher Gary Carter, former Yankee bullpen ace Sparky Lyle, New York Magazine contributing editor and baseball aficionado Will Leitch, and executive vice president of the Elias Sports Bureau Steve Hirdt. </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">The panel will breaks down a large list of players from each position and determine the top five from each spot on the diamond. By the end of each episode, they will crown the top player at each position and name him to the official “Lineup” card. </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">There is a cool fantasy game that goes with the whole series on <a href="https://www.msg.com/tv/shows/the-lineup">MSG.com</a></span><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">. Viewers can see how they stack up against The Lineup's experts. Fans will try to predict the five players who will be nominated each week and ultimately who will be selected as the starter in the final “Lineup.” Participants will receive points for each correct pick and will be eligible for weekly prizes such as signed memorabilia from baseball greats like Don Mattingly, Joe Torre, Reggie Jackson and Derek Jeter. At the end of the series, the participant with the most points will win a Grand Prize. The site will also feature chats for fans to interact and debate each position, quizzes about the nominated players, photo and video galleries, and player statistics for fans to comb through before making their picks.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="font-family: georgia, palatino;">They are already a couple episodes in, but you can still play for the weekly prizes. </span>
