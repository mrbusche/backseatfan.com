    I am not sure if this pass by Jordan Crawford of the Washington Wizards is the worst in NBA history, but it is somewhere up there. The ball slipped out of Crawford's hand and somehow flew behind him. Really terrible pass, I am not sure if he could do that twice. Seriously, how the hell did he accomplish that?
