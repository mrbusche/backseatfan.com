    This has to be the worst high school football play ever. Not only does he lose 50 yards by running backwards, he just throws the ball up for grabs afterwards, like one of his teammates was ready for the lateral. Wait, if he is going the wrong way is it still a lateral, or is that considered a pass? I guess it had to be a lateral  since technically it did go backwards, but that would be forwards for him.    Either way, still a terrible decision.
