  <p>
    The Buffalo Bills fired head coach Dick Jauron on Tuesday after a 3-6 start to the season. The Bills offense has been horrible and is one of the worst in the NFL.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="/images/2009/11/dickjauron.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2662" title="dickjauron" src="/images/2009/11/dickjauron.jpg" alt="dickjauron" width="403" height="227" srcset="/images/2009/11/dickjauron.jpg 576w, /images/2009/11/dickjauron-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Jauron's record was 24-33 since being hired as head coach of the Bills. He had two years remaining on his contract, which means a free $6 million for the 2009 and 2010 seasons that he isn't coaching in. If only I could become a coach, do shitty, and get fired? and get paid?
  </p>

  <p>
    Defensive coordinator Perry Fewell is expected to be named as the interim head coach.
  </p>

  <p>
    So who will want to coach in Buffalo? No one. It is cold, and their team isn't very good. Although the team could move to LA in a few years if they keep up there crappy ways. So maybe it is a good job. Perhaps Turner Gill will leave Buffalo to coach for Buffalo. Although the Buffalo college team is probably a better job. Even though they both have the same <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/clubhouse?teamId=2084"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">winning</span> Losing record</a>. Man, Gill really should have taken that Nebraska job.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe the same question should be asked, what free agent wants to play in Buffalo? Freezing city, <a href="https://www.patriots.com/">brutal schedule</a>. The only bonus is you get to visit <a href="https://www.miami.com/">Miami</a> once a year. But I guess the fans are good there too. Oooo and <a href="https://www.buffalowings.com/">Buffalo Wings</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Someone will eventually take the Buffalo job, and they will be their new savior. Buffalo fan's will welcome the change, and just hope that maybe this time, they will get a good coach.

    Marty Schottenheimeranyone? Fred Jackson would thrive in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Ball">his system</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wonder what the real excuse for why Dick Jauron was fired?
  </p>

  <p>
    1. He sucked
  </p>

  <p>
    2.<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/teams/stats?team=buf#pass"> Fred Jackson had a better passer rating than his QBs</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    3. T.O. Didn't like him
  </p>

  <p>
    4. He was as Dick
  </p>

  <p>
    5. Worst offense ever for all of the weapons they had
  </p>

  <p>
    6. He couldn't get past the 7-9 hump
  </p>

  <p>
    7. <a href="http://twitter.com/backseatfan/status/5809719194">He flicked off Bud Adams (Titans Owner)</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    8. He wouldn't be in <a href="https://www.vh1.com/shows/the_to_show/series.jhtml">T.O.'s Reality Show</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    9. He was losing on purpose to get out of Buffalo.
  </p>

  <p>
    10. He was looking ahead at the <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2009/09/27/speculation-commences-that-mangini-wont-make-it-to-january/">Brown's Job</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I guess we will never know the true answer?
