    Not good, Mike, Not Good. I expect a lot of hate mail flooding into your inbox, I hope you have an apology lined up.

    In his statement, released on today, Greenberg apologized both for what he said and as well as for not releasing an apology sooner. Greenberg's statement included, "I'm sorry that my talking too fast - and slurring my woods - might have given people who don't know our show the wrong impression about us, and about me." Earlier in the statement, Greenberg stated that he had just gotten back from the New York Knicks game and that "I apologize for not addressing it sooner".

    You think he would of had a better excuse for all of that extra time he had to think about it.
