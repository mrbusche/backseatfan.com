    Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll is a prankster. He set up the old snake in the Gatorade cooler bit. I love to see gigantic athletes jump back in terror, don't you? I saw a real snake at work the other day, just sitting in the hallway slithering around. I did do the jump back and the oh shit. Nobody likes snakes.
