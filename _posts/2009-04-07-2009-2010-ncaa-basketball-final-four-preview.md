    Listed below is the projected final four for the 2009-2010 NCAA Basketball season, with one sleeper team as well.
  </p>

  <h2>
    <strong>1. Kansas</strong>
  </h2>

  <p>
    After losing all their starters from their 2007 National Championship team the Jayhawks put together a fine 2008 season and will all the starters expected back in 2009 the Jayhawks are my pick to win the national title. Xavier Henry, the top recruit in the nation who was committed to Memphis has reopened his search and reportedly leaning toward choosing KU. Not to mention, Bill Self is one hell of a coach, and the 2008 Coach of the Year.
  </p>

  <h2>
    2. Michigan State
  </h2>

  <p>
    The Spartans may have surprised a lot of people this season by winning the Big Ten by 4 games and making it to the national title game, but next year they won't be sneaking up on anyone. In 2008 North Carolina got stomped by Kansas in the NCAA tournament and they came back to win the title this year. I think 2009 will be a similar year for Michigan State.
  </p>

  <h2>
    3. Syracuse
  </h2>

  <p>
    If Jonny Flynn returns for his junior year I think he can have an impact on the 'cuse like Carmelo did in 2003. Add in Eric Devendorf and Andy Rautins, two of the best perimeter shooters in the nation and the Orangemen should be a final four team in 2010.
  </p>

  <h2>
    4. Purdue
  </h2>

  <p>
    Robbie Hummel is the key to the Boilermakers success in the 2009-2010 season. He was sloweed by a fractured L5 vertebra this past season and he should be 100% next season. JaJuan Johnson was one of the Big Ten's best players this season and if Purdue has the season they are capable of Johnson could be the Big Ten player of the year.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Potential Sleeper - Connecticut
  </h2>

  <p>
    With all the controversey surrounding the UConn program and the possible retirement of Jim Calhoun it may be a surprise to see the Huskies on this list. If Kemba Walker returns for his sophomore season and Jerome Dyson, and Stanley Robinson return for their senior seasons that should make Calhouns decision to return next year an easy one.
