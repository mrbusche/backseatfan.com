    <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100808/ap_on_sp_fo_ne/fbn_nfl_heavyweights">NFL players are large</a>, larger than they have ever been.  40 years ago there was 1 player in the NFL that was over 300 pounds.  Now there are 394 players over 300 pounds. Either the NFL has gotten bigger and stronger, or Americans have really gotten fat.
