    How does Barry Melrose stay so young looking? Chickenshit. He applies it to his face at night to get rid of the crows feet. For the few hundred people watching First Take they were happy to get something good on TV. They should really just replace First Take with a replay of SportsNation ( A much better show, what <del datetime="2010-02-16T21:20:50+00:00">Cold Pizza</del>, I mean First Take could only wish to be).

    Here is an Apology from ESPN. Apparently Barry Melrose didn't see that big red light that said they were live on air. ESPN can't fire him for it, because they would totally give up on hockey then.
