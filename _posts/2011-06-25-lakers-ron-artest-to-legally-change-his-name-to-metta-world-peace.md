    A few years ago we had Chad Johnson changing his last name to Ochocinco. In 2003 Angel's pitcher Johan Santana changed his name to Ervin Santana while in the minor leagues. While in college Maurice Drew changed his name to Maurice Jones-Drew to honor his late grandfather. Former NBA basketball player Brian Williams changed his name to Bison Dele.

    And now current Lakers F Ron Artest has filed a petition to legally change his name to Metta World Peace. Metta stands for &#8220;The philosophy and practice of universal love&#8221;, I think we can figure out what the rest means. Artest cited personal reasons for wanting to make the change in court documents.
