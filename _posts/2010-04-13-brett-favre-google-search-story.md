    Is Brett Favre going to come back next year?Â  Only his Google search results will tell.

    I am pretty sure this is what Brett Favre searches for on Google every other day. Make up your mind Brett! Come back! It would be nice to know if the Vikings need to draft a new QB. Or if they have to settle on Jackson.
