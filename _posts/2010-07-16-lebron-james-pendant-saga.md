    Apparently Vaneisha Robinson bought this diamond studded pendant in the shape of LeBron James' jersey at a yard sale four years ago for $5 dollars.  Robinson claimed she thought  it was costume jewelry.
  </p>

  <p>
    She found out the pendant was real, got the pendant appraised, and it was worth nearly $10,000. She recently put the pendant up on eBay.

  <p>
    Now she is being investigated by police, because the pendant was  stolen.  The pendant was stolen from  LeBron's  Marketing CEO Maverick Carter.  She said she was threatened by Maverick's Mother, and they took the pendant from her.  Now shes going to sue Maverick's Mother.

  <p>
    Maybe next time she will be smart, and break that thing apart and sell the diamonds individually.
