  <h2>
    Pickups of the Week
  </h2>

  <p>
    Nate Washington, WR, Titans (Available in 79.2% of leagues)<br /> Washington was one of the trendiest sleepers this summer and then he got hurt and everyone forgot about him. He's owned in just 20% of leagues and should be owned in all 12 team leagues
  </p>

  <p>
    Mike Bell, RB, Saints (87.9%)<br /> Not sure how he is only owned in 12% of leagues. He should also be owned in all 12 team leagues. Pierre Thomas may not be healthy all season and Reggie Bush isn't exactly known for playing 16 games. He's the starting running back on one of the best offenses in football and unless you expect Drew Brees to throw for 96 TDs this year I expect Bell to get at least 8 TDs
  </p>

  <p>
    Michael Bush, RB, Raiders (87.5%)<br /> If you watched any of the Monday night game you saw the Raiders were able to run the ball effectively and as soon as they got inside the 5 McFadden was out and Bush was in. Expect about a TD a week from Bush.
  </p>

  <p>
    Shaun Hill, QB, 49ers (86.8%)<br /> He's a great fantasy option, just don't watch the games because he doesn't make it look pretty. He should put up a consistent 10-12 a week and is owned in almost zero leagues.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mark Sanchez, QB, Jets (77.7%)<br /> Sanchez plays for a team that can run the ball extremely well which will continue to open up the pass for the Jets. Rex Ryan won't put him in a situation to lose the Jets the game so he won't hurt your team at all. I wouldn't make him my starter but if you have Crabtree, Shonn Greene or someone else on the bench I'd drop them for Sanchez.
  </p>

  <p>
    Austin Collie, WR, Colts (99%)<br /> He'll be the #2 WR as long as Anthony Gonzalez is out which is currently 2-6 weeks but reports have speculated he could miss more.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Drops of the Week
  </h2>

  <p>
    Earnest Graham, RB, Bucaneers (Owned in 55.2% of leagues)<br /> Graham is pretty obviously the 3rd back in Tampa. Cadillac and Derrick Ward are ahead of him on the depth chart and it will stay that way unless one of them gets hurt.
  </p>

  <p>
    Chris Chambers, WR, Chargers (61%)<br /> Not sure why he was drafted in any league expect 20 team mans leagues. He's the 43rd option in the Chargers offense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rashard Mendenhall, RB, Pittsburgh (65.3%)<br /> Willie Parker is the goal line back and the every down back. Mewelde Moore is the 3rd down back. Mendenhall is just the bench back.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Avoids of the Week
  </h2>

  <p>
    Players who had big weeks that should not be picked up<br /> Kenny Britt, WR, Titans<br /> Miles Austin, WR, Cowboys<br /> Ben Watson, TE, Patriots<br /> Devery Henderson and Robert Meachem, WRs, Saints - They'll get you 100 yards a TD one week then 20 yards each of the next 4 weeks
  </p>

  <p>
    These guys are still owned in too many leagues, unless you're in a keeper league they should all be dropped: Jeremy Maclin, Shonn Greene, and Michael Crabtree.
