  <p>
    With the 43rd overall pick in the 2010 NBA Draft the Lakers selected West Virginia forward Devin Ebanks and with the 58th overall pick they selected Derrick Caracter a forward from Texas El Paso.

  <p>
    Ebanks is a strong defender with a decent mid range jump shot, but he made only 10 percent of his 3 point attempts last season. Â Ebanks' uncle grew up with Lamar Odom and he currently live just a few minutes away from Ron Artest and Lamar Odom. The three had become friends over the draft process, which likely contributed to the Lakers drafting him.
