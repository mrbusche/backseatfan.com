  <p>
    Cushing was suspended for four games this season after testing positive for HCG last September. HCG is a banned substance, and is commonly used after a steroid cycle to restart testosterone production.

    Cushing looks like a freaking monster.  If you had to pick out anyone in the room that was on steroids, you would pick Cushing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Houston Texans are asking the NFL to reduce Brain Cushing's four game suspension becauase of a medical contion that may have caused the  positive test.  The condition is called overtrained athlete syndrome.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cushing said that the syndrome can trigger hormonal spikes after breaks in training, which is why he tested positive for a fertility drug last September.  He claims that he never used the drug.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "I think that's the final diagnosis we came up with," he said, "and a lot of doctors have supported why this has happened."
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Cushing said months of tests show that he had a "unique" medical condition that led to the positive test.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "Every individual is genetically different," he said. "I had a unique situation where something like this occurred and we have the science to back it up. It's taken months. It's really beyond what we ever thought and it's beyond the regular medical doctor.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We've gone in depth, and there has been a lot of money spent on the research," he said. "There have been a lot of interesting results that I think can help us."
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    McNair repeatedly has said he believes Cushing, while also saying he supports the NFL's drug testing programs.
  </p>

  <p>
    "He has cooperated with us 100 percent," McNair said. "We've satisfied ourselves that there are no health issues, and also that there was no evidence at all that he's done anything at all that was not proper."
  </p>

    <strong>Reaction:</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Overtrained athlete syndrome?  Really?  You trigger a high spike in hormones after you take a break in training? So all of this positive testing is just because Cushing trained too hard? Where the hell did you come up with this?  Because that sounds a lot like how you take hormones after a steroid cycle.  Just a coincidence I guess?
  </p>

  <p>
    Bob McNair was this close to saying "He is as healthy as a horse".  A horse on steroids of course?  I don't think we can beleive any of this "medical research".  Sounds like they paid good money to get the results that they wanted to hear, and if it passes every athlete in professional sports will be diagnosed with this "rare disease".
