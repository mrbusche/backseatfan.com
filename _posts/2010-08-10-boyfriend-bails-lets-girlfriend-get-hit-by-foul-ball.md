    In Monday's Braves vs Astros game a boyfriend was seen bailing as a foul ball from Chris Johnson came hurling towards him and girlfriend. The girlfriend got hit on the arm and the boyfriend will live in infamy as the guy who let his girlfriend get hit with a baseball.

    The girlfriend had this to say, &#8220;As soon as we got here and I saw where we were sitting, I said 'Baby, I'm going to get hit,&#8221; Sarah said. &#8220;He said, 'No, you won't. I'll catch it if you do.' We just had this conversation and sure enough, the ball comes at me. He just bailed.&#8221;&#8221;As soon as we got here and I saw where we were sitting, I said 'Baby, I'm going to get hit,&#8221; Sarah said. &#8220;He said, 'No, you won't. I'll catch it if you do.'
