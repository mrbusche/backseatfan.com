    <br /> NCAA Tournament - Sweet Sixteen - Washington vs West Virginia Highlights
  </p>

  <p>
    #11 Washington Huskies lost to #2 West Virginia Mountaineers with a final score of 56-59. West Virginia was too big and strong for Washington to handle. The Huskies never really put up much of a fight against the Mountaineers.
