  <p>
    TroyÂ Tulowitzki and the Colorado Rockies have agreed to a new contract that will pay Tulowitzki an additional $134 million over seven seasons, through the 2020 season.
  </p>

  <p>
    &#8220;I'm really lucky,&#8221; Tulowitzki said. &#8220;I can't wait to be here my entire career.&#8221;
  </p>

  <p>
    Tulowitzki was deeply affected by the departure of his mentor Matt Holliday a couple years ago after the slugger spent 11 years with the organization. Tulowitzki wanted to spend his entire career in one city, just like his idol, Cal Ripken Jr did.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tulowitzki's 10-year contract is the eighth-highest in baseball history, trailing two of Alex Rodriguez's deals ($275 million and $252 million) and agreements for Derek Jeter ($189 million), Joe Mauer ($184 million), Mark Teixeira ($180 million), CC Sabathia ($161 million) and Manny Ramirez ($160 million).
  </p>

  <p>
    Tulowitzki, 26, had already been guaranteed $25.75 million through 2013 under the $31 million, six-year contract he agreed to in January 2008.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both sides are taking risks: Tulowitzki will be 35 by the time the contract expires and he could have some monster years during that time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite missing 33 games with a broken wrist last season, Tulowitzki won his first Gold Glove and NL Silver Slugger awards after hitting .315 with 27 homers and 95 RBIs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best moment of this whole ordeal is what Tulowitzki said about the contract, &#8220;I love the game and that's more than enough money than I'll ever need in my entire lifetime.&#8221;
