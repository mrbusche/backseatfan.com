    If you've been paying attention to college basketball this year you know the University of Miami Hurricanes are having a great season They started off the season 8-1 before dropping a game to then #4 Arizona and to an Indiana State team that slowed the game down to a ridiculously slow pace. Since their loss to the Sycamores the 'canes have rattled off 10 straight including roads wins at North Carolina and NC State and throttling at home of then #1 Duke. Miami started the season as 80-1 to win the title and are now 4-1 on many sports betting sites. If you<a href="http://www.marchmadnessaction.com/final-four.php"> Bet on Final 4</a> games Miami seems as good a bet as any. Lets not rule out a great Indiana team and also Florida and Michigan State among many others.

    I, like I assume many of you are, am looking forward to the release of the <a href="http://www.marchmadnessaction.com/bracket.php">NCAA tournament 2013 schedule</a> on Sunday March 17th.
