    Ben Roethlisberger's suspension has been cut down to four games by Roger Goodell. I never thought that Ben would serve the full 6 games unless he screwed up again during the offseason. I think it was a given that he was going to come back on October 17th against the Browns.

    It should be a good bounce back game for Ben. All Ben needs to do now is to not be accused of rape in the next 4 weeks. I know that sounds like a simple task, but hey, it's Big Douche we are talking about.

    Byron Leftwich was going to start in place of Ben Roethlisberger, but now he has as sprained MCL. Looks like the Steelers will be in the hands of Dennis Dixon for the fist game of the season. This is probably a good thing, since Leftwich is terrible.

    Here is Dennis Dixon's Preseason TD vs the Bills just to get all you Steeler fans pumped up!
