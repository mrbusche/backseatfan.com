  <p>
    Jared Allen did the a terrible thing this week, he cut his mullet. Apparently looking good for his wedding is more important than winning a Super Bowl. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson">Samson</a> lost all of his strength once his hair was cut, the same will happen to Jared Allen. Allen will lose all of his ability to play football, not sure who the Vikings are going to pick up at DE.

    I mean, you said it before business in front, party in the back. Isn't the front half of your mullet good enough for your wedding? Half of getting married is having the party afterwords. This just doesn't make sense? Needless to say, I'm disappointed in you.<br /> <strong>Before</strong>

    <strong><br /> </strong><br /> <strong> The Mullet is a Lifestyle</strong><br />
  </p>

  <p>
    According to Jared Allen the mullet is a lifestyle, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you live it</span>. And he said he might cut it, when he dies.  So should we put Jared Allen on suicide watch?
