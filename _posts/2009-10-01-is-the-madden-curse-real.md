<div class="entry">
  <p>
    With a new NFL season brings a new Madden Curse. For the first time in the History of Madden there are two players on the cover. So essentially, twice the curse.

      Lets take a look at who has been on the Cover of Madden and see if the Madden Curse is real.

            <td rowspan="2" width="312">
              Polamalu sprained his MCL in the first game vs Tennessee. He has missed two games so far, and the Steelers Defense hasn't been the same without him.<br /> Larry Fitzgerald has yet to record a 100 yard game. The Cardinals don't look the same as they did last year. Does Warner looking old count for the Fitzgerald curse?</p>

              <p>
                Both teams are 1-2 when I wrote this, I'll update it eventually, when Larry Fitzgerald is injured, due to the Madden Curse&#8230;</td> </tr>

                              Favre retired and un-retired, then retired again, then got traded to the Jets, maybe that had something to do with the Madden curse. Favre also injured his throwing arm (Torn Bicep Tendon) late in the season, which essential caused the Jets to have a late season collapse and essentially miss the playoffs.

George went to Ohio State, therefore by proxy the Ohio State Buckeyes were cursed and had a bad season in 2000. Found it. Mark one down for the Curse.

That is why he isn't on it anymore. And at his age, if he has one more Madden cover, it could be the end of John Madden.

Eddie George is really the only case I see where nothing happened to him. Statistically speaking 11/13 players have had somewhat of a curse, and it could be 12/13 after this season. If you are a player thinking about being on the cover, I don't really like the odds.
