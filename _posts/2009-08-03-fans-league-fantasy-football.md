  <p>
    We are looking to get 14 Fan's out there to make a 16-Man Fantasy Football League. We don't know how many people will want to play. So we would just like to get an idea. So email us, tweet us, or leave us a comment if you would like to particpate in the Fan's league. If there are a ton of people that want to show their Fandom, We might throw out a Team name contest to see who wins those iconic 14 spots. It is all free, the only thing we are playing for is pride, maybe something else, I just haven't figured that part out yet. Email us at <a href="mailto: backseatfan@gmail.com">backseatfan@gmail.com</a>, tweet us <a href="https://twitter.com/backseatfan">@backseatfan</a>, or leave a comment, but make sure to enter your email in the mail field or else we can't get a hold of you (your email will not be published).

    We will be writing an article or so a week about how everyones doing, what idiotic moves everyone has made, and maybe a preview of the matches. Hopefully it will be fun, please let us know if you are interested!
