    Eleven year old Nate Shannon from Genoa, IL plows through an entire team for a touchdown on his first carry ever. Ever. Think about it, this kid has never taken a handoff in a game before, and he was able to accomplish this. He broke through ever tackle, from just about everyone on the other team. At one point he was dragging 4 or 5 players along with him. It is amazing to watch, even if it is just a 6th grader, it would be amazing if it was a 1st grader. Who knows if he will be a star running back, but after watching this video, I hope he is.
