  <p>
    According to Cincinnati Enquirer Bengals writer <a href="http://twitter.com/joereedy/statuses/6782916826">Joe Reedy's twitter account</a> a witness at the scene of the accident reporting Henry said the following, <span><span>&#8220;If you take off, I'm going to jump off the truck and kill myself.&#8221; </span></span><br /> If this is true, what a drastic turn of events this would be. Such a sad, sad story. Our thoughts go out to Chris Henry's family and his Bengals family.
