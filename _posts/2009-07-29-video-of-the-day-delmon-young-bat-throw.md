    In <span title="04-26">April </span>2006, while playing for the Triple-A Durham Bulls in a game against the Pawtucket Red Sox, Delmon Young threw his bat at the umpire after being called out on strikes. He stared the umpire down and refused to leave the batter's box. As he headed towards the dugout, he threw the bat at the umpire. The bat hit the umpire on his chest and arm but luckily he was not hurt. We here at Backseat Fan do not condone or support bat throwing, so you can't blame us for anything. But it is a pretty funny clip. Enjoy.
