    The Vuvuzela is pretty much the most popular 'musical' instrument this summer. Why not have the creator of the vuvuzella come out and talk about it? Ahh the sweet sweet sound of the vuvuzella. It just makes your ears bleed uncontrollably. Not Ferrell's best work, but still good for a few laughs.
