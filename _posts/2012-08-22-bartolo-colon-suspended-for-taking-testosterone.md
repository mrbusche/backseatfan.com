    The Oakland A’s Starting pitcher Bartolo Colon has been suspended 50 games for violating MLB’s drug policy. Colon tested positive for testosterone and will miss the remaining 40 games of this season and any 10 postseason games if the A’s reach the postseason.

    Although Colon has had a decent season going 10-9 with a 3.43 ERA, this just proves that PED’s can’t make you that good. It turned a career 4.05 ERA guy into a 3.43 ERA guy, not a ton better, but it probably gave him enough juice to compete at 39 years young.

    Testosterone levels seem to be high in the Bay Area.
