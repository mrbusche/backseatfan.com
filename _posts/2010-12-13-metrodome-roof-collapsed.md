    The Minnesota Viking's Metrodome Stadium roof collapsed early Sunday morning. They moved the Vikings - Giants to Detroit at Ford Field.

    This comes at a time where the Vikings are rallying for a new stadium. I wonder if this will be in their keynote presentation.

    I don't think they will be able to get it ready for next week vs the Bears. I expect the game to be at the Minnesota Gophers brand new stadium.
