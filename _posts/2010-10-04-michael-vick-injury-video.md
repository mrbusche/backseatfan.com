    Eagle's QB Michael Vick was hit hard by two defenders on the scramble. Vick is getting an MRI today to determine his injury. X-rays were negative on broken ribs, but apparently it could be torn cartilage between the sternum and the ribs.

  <p>
    Vick is injury prone since he puts himself in situations that leaves him susceptible to big hits. He will be out for at least a few weeks, but expect him to take the reigns at QB back over when he returns.
