    TO won't be returning to the Buffalo Bills next season, they do not want to re-sign the 36 year old WR. But TO still has some skills left right? TO caught 55 passes for 829 yards and five touchdowns last year in Buffalo, with a terrible QB.

      &#8220;I would like to thank the great fans in Buffalo, Ralph Wilson & the Bills organization for all their supports this past season,&#8221; Owens said on Twitter.

    I think TO still has something left in his tank. It is just a matter of finding a place for him to go. Bengals and the Ravens might be interested. My hope is for the Bengals, because he told Chad OchoCinco that he would change his name to Terrell Ocho Uno if he was on the Bengals. That would be the best thing ever. But then again, two &#8220;diva&#8221; WRs on one team would be a coaches nightmare.
