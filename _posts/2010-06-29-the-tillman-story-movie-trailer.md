    Pat Tillman was an NFL player on the rise, and gave it all up to join the Army to become a Ranger.   There was a big controversy on how Pat Tillman died, and this movie tells the real story.  It looks like it should be good, everyone loves a good government conspiracy plot, oh wait this is real life.
