  <p>
    Darrelle Revis ended his 35 day hold out and finally signed a new contract with the Jets.  Revis' contract isa  4 year deal worth 46 million with 32 million Guaranteed. Revis wanted to be the highest paid cornerback in the league, he didn't manage that.  But he is still one of the highest paid, and got a ton of guaranteed money.  I think it is a win - win for both the Jets and Revis.  Revis is worth the money, and he should be one of the highest paid cornerbacks.

    Rex Ryan flew down to help with negotiations, we can only hope that the talk with Revis will be on Hard Knocks.

    Really, what is the difference between the two, a few million dollars?  Chump change to both the Jets and Revis.
