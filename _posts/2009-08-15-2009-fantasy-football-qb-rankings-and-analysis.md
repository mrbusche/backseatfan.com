    The first number listed in the ranking of that player in their position, the 2nd number is the overall ranking I gave them in this<a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2009/08/overall-top-200-fantasy-players-for-the-2009-fantasy-football-season/">post</a>

    Quarterbacks
  </h2>

  <p>
    <strong>1 11 Drew Brees, NO</strong> - The Saints defense is improved from last year but they will still need to put up points, they also have a fairly easy schedule this year since they were last in the division in 2008.<br /> <strong>2 12 Tom Brady, NE</strong> - Doesn't look like he's missed a beat from the 2007 season, the addition of a real running back should cut back on his passes in the red zone.<br /> <strong>3 15 Aaron Rodgers, GB</strong> - It wasn't Rodgers who lost the Packers games last season, it was the defense. The defense hasn't changed much so his numbers should be much of the same.<br /> <strong>4 19 Peyton Manning, Ind</strong> - Still one of the best in the game.<br /> <strong>5 36 Philip Rivers, SD</strong> - With a healthy Antonio Gates and Chris Chambers he should throw for more TDs than 2008.<br /> <strong>6 44 Kurt Warner, Ari</strong> - He won't repeat his numbers from last season but he'll put up 4,000 yards and 24 TDs<br /> <strong>7 50 Donovan McNabb, Phi</strong> - Offense has the chance to be one of the best in the NFL. The addition of a burner in Maclin and another backfield receiver in McCoy should improve his numbers from last season.<br /> <strong>8 51 Matt Ryan, Atl</strong> - Michael Turner won't see 370 carries again this season, expect the Falcons to throw it more this year<br /> <strong>9 52 Tony Romo, Dal</strong> - I don't like any of their WRs so he falls to #9 but Jason Witten is a top 5 TE and few backs catch the ball better out of the backfield than Marion Barber<br /> <strong>10 63 Matt Schaub, Hou</strong> - If healthy he could be a top 5 QB if not he's not even in the top 20, here's to hoping he stays healthy this season. At least there won't be anymore of the Sage Rosenfels<a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2009/08/sage-rosenfels-helicopter-daily-video/">helicopter plays</a> this season<br /> <strong>11 69 Carson Palmer, Cin</strong> - See above<br /> <strong>12 70 Jay Cutler, Chi</strong> - Goodbye Brandon Marshall and Eddie Royal. Hello Rashied Davis!<br /> <strong>13 79 Matt Hasselbeck, Sea</strong> - Up until last year Hasselbeck was one of the few quarterbacks you could rely on from year to year, he should be healthy this season but the lack of a running game hurts him.<br /> <strong>14 80 Ben Roethlisberger, Pit</strong> - He's a much better real life quarterback than fantasy quarterback, but he'll be a viable bye week fill in<br /> <strong>15 87 Eli Manning, NYG</strong> - Very young wide receiver core and great backfield hurts his fantasy numbers<br /> <strong>16 105 Matt Cassel, KC</strong> - Don't expect a repeat of 2008<br /> <strong>17 107 Kyle Orton, Den</strong> - He was a viable fantasy option in 2008 but injuries slowed him in the 2nd half. The improved receivers will help but he's still just a bye week fill in.<br /> <strong>18 115 David Garrard, Jac</strong> - He was everyones break out player last year, but he didn't, they have Torry Holt but no one else at WR to catch the ball.<br /> <strong>19 126 Trent Edwards, Buf</strong> - He has a good set of options in the passing game but his decision making skills are still bad and with their tough schedule he will probably throw a lot of interceptions this year<br /> <strong>20 128 Joe Flacco, Bal</strong> - Flacco will most likely have the same stats he had in 2008, those worthy of a low QB2<br /> <strong>21 130 Jeff Garcia, Oak</strong> - He's currently the backup, but if the Raiders want to win games this year they'll start Garcia<br /> <strong>22 132 Chad Pennington, Mia</strong> - Pennington managed the game brilliantly for the Dolphins last season but you don't get points in fantasy for game management or team wins.<br /> <strong>23 134 Mark Sanchez, NYJ</strong> - Looks like he'll win the starting job in New York, but there are few rookies who have ever been good fantasy options.<br /> <strong>24 135 Jake Delhomme, Car</strong> - Has a tendency to disappear in games but may make a decent bye week fill in for you.<br /> <strong>25 148 Jason Campbell, Was</strong> - Just like Trent Edwards, he doesn't always make great decisions<br /> <strong>26 159 Michael Vick, Phi</strong> - The odds are he won't start at all this season, but McNabb has been known to have injury issues. He's a great value pick in the 15th or 16th round<br /> <strong>27 167 Shaun Hill, SF</strong> - He's currently being undrafted in most leagues, but if he wins the starting job for the 49ers he'll make a good bye week fill in.
