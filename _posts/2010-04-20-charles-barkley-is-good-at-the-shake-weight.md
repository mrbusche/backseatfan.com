    It looks like Charles might have practiced a few times, with the shake weight, before the show.    Why is his first reaction to shake it by his mouth?

    Kudos to the crew at TNT, they were just trying to make sure Barkley was healthy, <del datetime="2010-04-20T13:46:18+00:00">keeping</del> getting him in shape for the show.  Right?
