  <p>
    USC defensive back Taylor Mays' ran a 40-yard dash that was measured at 4.24 seconds, then later it was corrected to 4.43 seconds. When he is pictured with all of the top sprinters he is faster than Trindon Holliday, who was officially clocked at 4.34. There are some errors here somewhere. They should be ok though, its not like teams spend millions of dollars on these guys. They don't need accurate numbers right? Oh wait?
