    It turns out white men can jump, well at least Jacob Tucker can.  Tucker is a 5'11" tall senior from Illinois College with a 50 inch running vertical. He is trying to get in the NCAA dunk competition with this video.  Based on these dunks, I declare him the winner. You can vote for his spot in the NCAA dunk competition by going to <a href="https://Facebook.com/collegeslam">Facebook</a> and voting on Thursday, March 17th.

    Be sure to check out his last few dunks, those are really amazing.
