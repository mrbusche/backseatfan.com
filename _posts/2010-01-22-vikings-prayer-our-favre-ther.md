<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Got this Viking Prayer off of Facebook. Hope I don't go to hell for posting it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our Favre-ther who art in Minnesota hallowed be thy name.<br /> Thy Bowl will come, it will be won, in Miami as it is in thy Dome.<br /> Give us this Sunday, our weekly win.<br /> Give us touchdown passes, but do not let others pass against us.<br /> Lead us not into frustration, but deliver us to thy Super Bowl.<br /> For thine is the MVP, the best in the NFC,<br /> and glory of the Purple People Eaters now and forever.
  </p>

  <p>
    AMEN
  </p>
