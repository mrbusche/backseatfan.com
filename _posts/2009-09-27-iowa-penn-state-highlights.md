    Iowa's defense is crazy, they are going to dominate most teams. Their offense needs a lot of work if they are going to compete for the Big 10 Championship. Here are a few things that I saw:
  </p>

  <p>
    1. Ricky Stanzi stares down his receivers, and only throws to the first read. I never see him read progressions, he needs to stop gawking at his receivers before he throws. He has some work to do, but he has a lot of upside and potential. Great job on the TD run, he saw the hole and kept the ball.
  </p>

    2. Iowa is still a power running team without Shonn Greene. Wegher and Robinson are a nice combination, and it is hard to tell which RB I like more. Iowa just needs to pound the ball a little more, and the offense will start rolling. Iowa is set at RB for years to come with these two freshman backs.
  </p>

    3. Can punters be in the Heisman race? Iowa's punter Ryan Donahue had a terrific outing vs Penn State. He has tremendous accuracy and great power in his punts. I can see him punting at the next level.
  </p>

    4. Iowa's new ranking is 13, which is behind Ohio State, and in front of Penn State. Personally I would have liked to see Iowa in the top ten ahead of Ohio State, but I can live with 13th. Iowa will go up when they beat every team that they face.

    Overall I am pleased with the Hawkeyes production so far, and I think that they will improve as the season goes on. The defense doesn't really need to improve, but the offense has a little work to do. My advice is just run it, maybe it will help calm Stanzi down, and open the passing game a little. Iowa has two capable backs with a ton of potential and I think they just need to utilize them more than the pass..
