  <p>
    According to reports from the Star Tribune and Fox's Jay Glazer, Brett Favre is going to retire.
  </p>

  <p>
    Apparently Favre is retiring due to his inability to come back from his ankle injury and wear and tear to his old man body.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Favre has sent text messages to teammates saying, &#8220;This is it,&#8221; league sources told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <strong>&#8220;This is It&#8221; was also the name of Michael Jackson's last tour&#8230; Which means:</strong>
  </p>

  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <strong>A.)</strong> Favre is going unretire and play for one more season<br /> <strong>B.)</strong> Favre is going to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/15/sports/pro-football-favre-says-he-abused-painkillers-and-will-enter-treatment-center.html">overdose on painkillers</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Although both are possible, I think Favre is going to unretire again.  This is Favre's third retirement, he unretired twice before, he will unretire again.
  </p>

  <p>
    He want's to build up the drama, he wants to get people talking, he wants people to want him back.  Everyone and their mother assumed Favre was coming back, so nobody made a big deal about it. Favre doesn't like that.  He wants to be on ESPN, he wants to be in all of the newspapers.  That's why he <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2010/04/favre-needs-ankle-surgery/">announced his surgery to Ed Werder</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=10&ved=0CD8QFjAJ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbackseatfan.com%2F2010%2F02%2Fbrett-favre-injury-pictures%2F&ei=9TxYTJS0EsT58Ab1n9CUCw&usg=AFQjCNFCwtapVp8a6RsgElpZhkyoexDVFQ">took pictures of his disgusting ankle.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    I won't believe that Favre is fully retired until he signs the papers and ships them in.  Even when he does that there is still a small chance he will get the itch and want to come back.<br /> So let's redefine retirement for Favre&#8230; He Needs to send his retirement papers in, and be retired for 2 season in order for me to consider him retired.
  </p>

  <p>
    When will Favre come back?  My Guess is about the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fsm0WIXqcE&feature=related">same time he came back last season</a>.  He will test his ankle out at the local high school, he will tell reporters he feels great, and Brad Childress will drive him into the Vikings Headquarters in a blacked out SUV. Favre will hold the same awww shucks press conference as he did last year.  And we will all eat it up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without Favre the Vikings will still be good, but they are not going to be a Super Bowl contender.  They have all the pieces in place to make Favre a Super Bowl Champion, without him they aren't quite there.
  </p>

  <p>
    Favre will be back for his 20th season, and he will be ready to go after another Super Bowl.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Update:</strong></span> Childress says he's not aware of Favre's intent to retire&#8230; Either Childress is lying or Favre just got bored today and decided to spread some rumors&#8230;
