    This week 10 NFL matchup has strong playoff implications for both teams. A loss by the Lions and they're all but eliminated from playoff contention.  A loss by the Vikings may seal their fate as well. This game is more critical for the Lions as the Vikings can still control their own destiny with 2 games each against Chicago and Green Bay.

    Percy Harvin is listed as questionable for the Vikings which is a huge blow to their offense. Losing Percy would mean Kyle Rudolph being utilized more in the passing game and not blocking for Adrian Peterson, although I don't know if Adrian needs blocking the way he's been running this year.

    Mike Leshoure has been quite the surprise for the Lions this year as has Joique Bell who quietly has nearly 500 yards in 9 games this year. Bell is another running back from a small college, Wayne State, that has had a nice season. Chris Ivory, from Tiffin is another player who has succeeded so far in the NFL despite being from a small college.
