    Tim Lincecum pitched a gem of a game and Edgar Renteria provided the offense with a 3 run home run in the 7th inning. The home run by Renteria follows his go ahead home run in game 2 and unforgettably his 11th inning World Series winning single in 1997. Renteria was named World Series MVP after batting .412 with 2 3-run home runs.

    The Giants appear on the surface to be a rag tag bunch of hitters, but it was definitely their pitching that won them this World Series. Tim Lincecum and Matt Cain are as good a 1-2 punch as any team in the league. Cain did not allow an earned run in the postseason. Don't forget about 21-year-old rookie Madison Bumgarner who blanked the Rangers in game 4.

    San Francisco is a team built for the postseason after barely slipping into the playoffs after a 92-70 regular season record. The San Francisco offense was not near the top of the league in any categories, but when you have pitching like that you don't need to be.
