    As I was watching the US Open over this weekend I happened to stumble upon the stats on David Duval's world rankings. In 1999, Duval was ranked No. 1 in the world for 15 weeks. Over the last 10 year we have watched him struggle and watched his ranking spiral down to No. 882 just before the US Open.But it just made me wonder if anyone is going to challenge Tiger for the No. 1 ranking. I know Phil Mickelson is challenging him, and others have tried to step up to the plate,but seriously, Tiger is a freaking beast and is unstoppable.Tigerwas even injured most of last year and was still No. 1 golfer in the world. So will Tiger Woods ever lose his No. 1 ranking? Here is my not so logical prediction:

    I don't think that Tiger will ever lose his No. 1 ranking. People love Tiger, and the love watching him play, and they will always see him as the best. Even after he retires he will still be the best golfer ever and he will probably still be No. 1 in the world.He could be the 99 and barely be able to lift a club and he would still be ranked No. 1.Everyone will always think &#8220;Hey, maybe he will comeback, maybe he will be able to play in another tournament.&#8221; So instead of ESPN talking about Favre unretiring, or whoever else, maybe they will be talking about Tiger unretiring. I think that the PGA should retire the No. 1 ranking just like the NFL, NBA, and MLB retire a jersey number for a player.Tiger doesn't really have a jersey number, so retiring the No. 1 ranking in the world would be the best way to honor him. Maybe it will be a new exciting factor in golf, to see who will be No. 2 in the world. Because we all know who will always be Number one.
