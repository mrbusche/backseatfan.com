    Minor League baseball manager for the State College Spikes steals first base, signs it, and gives it to a fan. The manager, Gary Robinson, Â was claiming that the ball hit the bat, and not the player. The Umpire disagrees, and the manager just goes crazy. I don't quite understand why baseball managers can go crazy on umpires. I have never seen a football coach grab the yardsticks, autograph them, and give them to a fan. Is it all done just out of boredom? I've seen basketball coaches get a little mad, but baseball coaches just seem insane when they go off.
