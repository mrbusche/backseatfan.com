    Kenyon Martin went crazy on his Denver Nuggets teammates when someone filled his Range Rover up with Buttered Popcorn for April Fools.
  </p>

  <p>
    Apparently Martin had white interior, and didn't like the buttery goodness messing up his Range Rover. Because you know the trade in value isn't the same when you get those little kernels in-between the seats.

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I swear to God, boy ? when I find out who did it .. I'm gonna put my mother fuckin' hands on one of y'all."
    </p>

    <p>
      "I'm gonna put my hands on whoever did it ? you best believe dat ? it's fuckin' personal ? you best believe it.
    </p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The Prankster was the driver of teammate J.R. Smith. The driver apologized for the prank, but Martin reportedly won't accept the apology.
  </p>

  <p>
    My guess is Kenyon got teased as a kid, and really hates being pranked, that's why it was so personal.  Because really, is buttered popcorn in a car really that personal?  You make 16 Million a year, pay 300 dollars to get it detailed, it will smell like buttered popcorn, but look like new.
