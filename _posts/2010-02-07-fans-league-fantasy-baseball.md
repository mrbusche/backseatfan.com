  <p>
    We are now taking applications for entry into our Fan's Fantasy Baseball League. If you are interested please leave a comment with your email address filled out (this will not be displayed to website users) or send us an email to <a href="mailto:info@backseatfan.com">info@backseatfan.com</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rules can be discussed when we finalize members but here is what I'm thinking
  </p>

  <p>
    - Mixed league (AL and NL)
  </p>

  <p>
    - 14 teams in addition to Ryan and I
  </p>

  <p>
    - Positions - C,1B,2B,SS,3B,OF(4),P(7)
  </p>

  <p>
    - Bench - probably 5 more players than starters
  </p>

  <p>
    - If enough people would like we can add a 5th OF spot as well as corner infield and middle infield positions.
  </p>

  <p>
    - Standard 5&#215;5 league, unless you would like to expand to 6&#215;6 or 7&#215;7.
  </p>

  <p>
    - Rotisserie or Head to Head League? I'm leaning towards a roto league, but that can be voted upon as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Opening day in April 4th. I think we should hold the draft on April 2nd or 3rd. Registration will be closed March 27th so that we can notify the 14 winners and alternates if necessary.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the coming two months we will have plenty of fantasy baseball stories as well as our rankings for the 201o season.
  </p>

  <p>
    As we receive suggestions this post will be updated with polls for voting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Good Luck!
