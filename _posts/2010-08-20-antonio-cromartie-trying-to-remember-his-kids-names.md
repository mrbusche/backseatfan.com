    Antonio Cromartie has 8 kids with 7 different women. It seemed like he was struggling to remember their names on Hard Knocks. I'm not sure how that works with visitation. I don't know if he has all the kids at once, or if he rotates them in and out. I wonder if all of his kids even know they have brothers and sisters.

    All of them seem to be about 3 years old. So he had one really bad year of getting girls pregnant. NFL players, use a rubber or you will be up to your neck in child support.
