  <p>
    It all started with a few comments by the Reds' second baseman Brandon Phillip:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      &#8220;I'd play against these guys with one leg. We have to beat these guys,&#8221; Phillips told the DDN. &#8220;I hate the Cardinals. All they do is [complain] and moan about everything, all of them. &#8230; I really hate the Cardinals. Compared to the Cardinals, I love the Chicago Cubs. Let me make this clear: I hate the Cardinals.&#8221;
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Phillips was the lead off hitter at the bottom of the first. He tapped his bat on Molina’s shin guard in a friendly gesture. Molina didn't take it quite so friendly.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “The comment he made yesterday that he’s got no friends over here—then why you touch me?” Molina said. “You are not my friend, so don’t touch me. I mean, if we’re no good for you, you are not my friend.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I'm sure they exchanged a few more choice words. Then Phillips took off his helmet, Molina removed his mask, and both benches and bullpens emptied.
  </p>

    If you paid for those behind the dugout seats you got a good show. The managers were the only ones who got ejected, but expect to see a few fines for players.
