<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Four years after tested positive for a synthetic testosterone at the 2006 Tour de France, Floyd Landis finally admitted that he used performance-enhancing drugs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Landis used a series of illegal substances, that include red blood cell booster erythropoietin (EPO), testosterone, human growth hormone and frequent blood transfusions, female hormones and a one-time experiment with insulin, during the his time with the U.S. Postal Service and Switzerland-based Phonak teams.
  </p>

  <p>
    So now that Landis came clean, he thinks everyone else should too. So he sent emails to anti-doping officials with names of athletes, managers, and owners that have used performance enhancing drugs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lance Armstrong was called out by Landis, he told reporters Thursday: "I have nothing to hide," and "history speaks for itself here."
  </p>

  <p>
    The World Anti-Doping Agency said in a statement Thursday that they would open an investigation into Landis' allegations.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "I don't feel guilty at all about having doped. I did what I did because that's what we [cyclists] did and it was a choice I had to make after 10 years or 12 years of hard work to get there, and that was a decision I had to make to make the next step. My choices were, do it and see if I can win, or don't do it and I tell people I just don't want to do that, and I decided to do it." - Floyd Landis
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I listened to the segment that Mike and Mike did about Floyd Landis. They were debating weather Landis was a whistle-blower or a snitch. They came up with a great definition of each.
  </p>

  <p>
    A whistle-blower is someone who didn't do anything wrong, doesn't approve, and they called out the people who did. A tattle tail.
  </p>

  <p>
    A Snitch is someone who gets caught doing something wrong, and rats out other people who are doing it.
  </p>

  <p>
    So Landis is a snitch, and a liar.
  </p>

  <p>
    If I were going to trust anyone that calls someone a cheater, I'd wouldn't trust Floyd Landis.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am keeping an eye on <a href="http://twitter.com/lancearmstrong">Lance Armstrong's Twitter</a> to see if anything good comes up.
