    Last night wasn't just a loss for the Vikings in the standings they also lost starting MLB EJ Henderson to a broken leg. After missing most of last season with dislocated toes, EJ Henderson broke his leg in a gruesome hit last night against the Cardinals. Jamarica Sanford and EJ converged to make a tackle on Arizona RB Tim Hightower and Sanford hit EJ's extended left leg, breaking his femur. If you are a little squeamish, don't watch the video, it's vicious. Here's to a speedy recovery, we'll be thinking of you EJ!
