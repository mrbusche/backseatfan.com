  <p>
    <a href="https://www.tmz.com">TMZ.com</a> reports that they are going to premiere the footage of Lebron James being dunked on TMZ TV tonight. They will also be posting the uncut in-your-face slam on the website at 6:45 PM EST. Hopefully we can get a copy of video on Backseat Fan later tonight.

    My guess is that the dunk isn't anything too special. Lebron James should have never confiscated the video in the first place. But I hope he just gets crushed.

    UPDATE: <a href="https://backseatfan.com/index.php/2009/07/lebron-james-gets-dunked-on-video/">The video is up.</a> After all the hype I didn't think that was that great of a dunk. Publicity stunt by Nike?
