    <em>It has been somewhat of a slow news day for us so I am releasing the Daily Spin a little early, enjoy. Hopefully I will get a few other articles up by the end of the day.  Come on first round signings!</em>

    <a href="https://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100726&content_id=12663932&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb">Chris Coghlan was injured while trying to smash a shaving-cream pie </a>in the face of Wes Helms, who had the game winning walk-off single. [via <a href="https://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100726&content_id=12663932&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb">MLB</a>]

    <a href="https://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100725/stadiumconcessions">ESPN's "Outside the Lines" reviewed health department inspection reports</a> for food and beverage outlets at all 107 North American arenas and stadiums of the MLB, NFL, NHL and NBA teams in 2009?  You might think twice before getting a hamburger at a game, not just because of the price?

    Now After Reading the story above, find the<a href="https://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/baseball/mlb/all-star-ballpark-menu/index.html"> best food in MLB Ball Parks</a>, but check the inspection sheet first?

    NFL players and personnel that are under pressure?  [via <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=AgUOP0QdOBUd4laf3A4l.dg5nYcB?slug=jc-campscrutiny072310">Yahoo Sports</a>]

  <p>
    <a href="https://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/news/story?id=5412850&campaign=rss&source=NFLHeadlines">Jets are looking into Terrell Owens</a>?  I think the chances of him going to the Jets are small, but he could be a good pick up to replace the suspended Santonio Holmes the first 4 weeks? I am still hoping for Cincy so we can get Ocho Uno!  [ via <a href="https://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/news/story?id=5412850&campaign=rss&source=NFLHeadlines">ESPN</a>]

    Tennessee Titans sue Lane Kiffin for luring assistant to USC? What?  A USC coach doing something that us unethical?  That is unheard of! [via <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ap-titans-usclawsuit">Yahoo Sports</a>]
