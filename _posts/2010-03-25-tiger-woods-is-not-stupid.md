    Tiger Woods announced that he will have his Master's media day on Monday April 5, at 2 pm. Normally he would have this media day on Tuesday. Curious move by Tiger, right? I wonder what else is going on Monday April 5th? Two things come to mind&#8230;.

  <p>
    Baseballâ€™s Opening Day and the NCAA Tournament National Championship.

    Tiger isn't stupid, and he knows exactly what he is doing. He knows has to face the fire of a press conference eventually, so why not do it on a busy sports day? Smart move Tiger. Smart Move.

    I wonder what the first clip on SportsCenter will be that night&#8230;

    It better be University of Northern Iowa winning the National Championship!
