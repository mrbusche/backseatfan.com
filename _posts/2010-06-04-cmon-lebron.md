    C'mon LeBron, come to New York where you will be surrounded with worse players than you had at Cleveland.  C'mon.  New York does have a large media section, and visitors, and a mayor that want you to be there.  Really anywhere LeBron goes people will kiss the ground he walks on.  Except for maybe Cleveland now, ahhh lets face it the will kiss the ground he walks on too.
