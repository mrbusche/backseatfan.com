  <p>
    <strong>New York Yankees vs Los Angeles Angels</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Yankees have announced they will use a 3 man rotation which will allow CC to pitch in games 1,4, and 7. The Angels have two of the best guys in the league when it comes to working the count in Chone Figgins and Bobby Abreu. If those two guys can work the count and continue their dominance of the Yankees this will be a great series. John Lackey, Joe Saunders, Jared Weave and Scott Kazmir will also be huge in this series. I think this will be a great series and whoever wins will easily win the World Series. Angels in 7.

  <p>
    <strong>Philadelphia Phillies vs Los Angeles Dodgers</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Phillies don't have anyone they trust to pitch rather than Cliff Lee and Cole Hamels and I think that could spell doom for them in this series. Hiroki Kuroda was dominant against the Phillies this year and he is scheduled to pitch in game 3. I think the Dodgers bats continue their hot streak as the series start of with 2 in LA. A 2-0 deficit will be too much for the Phillies to overcome. Dodgers in 6.
