    CBS is reporting University of Connecticut head coach Jim Calhoun will not coach vs. Chattanooga today because of an illness that has sent him to the hospital. Associate Head Coach George Blaney with coach the team in Calhoun's absence.

    UConn director of sports medicine Dr. Jeff Anderson said, &#8220;Coach Calhoun has not been feeling well for the past several days and it is best that he not coach the team today for precautionary reasons,&#8221; according to a release issued by the school.

    UConn did not speculate on whether the coach would be available for the probable second round game. Calhoun battled his second stint with cancer this past summer. He showed no ill effects throughout the course of the season after his radiated treatments were completed in August.

  <p>
    Hopefully this is unrelated to his previous bouts with cancer and is a flu bug. Get well soon Coach Calhoun.

    What do you guys thinks, does this open up the possibility of UConn being the first number one seed to lose to a sixteen? Or does this just put the margin of victory closer to 15 instead of 30?
