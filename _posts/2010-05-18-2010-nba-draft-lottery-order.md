<div class="entry">
  <p>
    The Washington Wizards won the 2010 NBA Draft Lottery and will have the No. 1 pick in the 2010 NBA Draft next month draft. The Nets had the worst record, and got the shaft in the lottery and fell to third.
  </p>

  <p>
    1. Washington<br /> 2. Philadelphia<br /> 3. New Jersey<br /> 4. Minnesota<br /> 5. Sacramento<br /> 6. Golden State<br /> 7. Detroit<br /> 8. LA Clippers<br /> 9. Utah (From New York via Phoenix)<br /> 10. Indiana<br /> 11. New Orleans<br /> 12. Memphis<br /> 13. Toronto<br /> 14. Houston
  </p>

  <p>
    So it looks like John Wall is going to the Wizards, unless there is some sort of trade.
