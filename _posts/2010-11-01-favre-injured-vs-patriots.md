  <p>
    Favre was injured during the Patriots game last night.  He took a helmet under the chin, which caused him to leave the game and get eight stitches. <a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/09000d5d81bc37f5/Brett-Favre-injury">Heres the video.</a>

    Favre actually played surprisingly well last night, even though he did leave the game in the fetal position.

      There is no way Favre doesn't play next week.  If he played this week with two broken ankles, he is going to play next week with to broken ankles and a busted up chin.
