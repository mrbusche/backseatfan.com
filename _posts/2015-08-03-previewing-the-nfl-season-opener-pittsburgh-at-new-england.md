  <p>
    In just over 5 short weeks the Pittsburgh Steelers with travel to Foxboro to face the New England Patriots in a game each team will be missing arguably their best players. The Patriots will be missing Tom Brady who currently is suspended the first games of the season and the Steelers will be missing Le'Veon Bell. Now you could argue that Rob Gronkowski and Ben Roethlisberger are the teams best players and you wouldn't receive a ton of argument from me, but an improved Steelers defense with <a href="https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/nfl-pittsburgh-steelers-news/2015/6/5/8737883/steelers-first-round-pick-bud-dupree-is-a-quick-study-but-has-a-long">Bud Dupree</a> and Senquez Golson could put a lot of pressure on Jimmy Garoppolo which could put an end to that debate.

    A leading sportsbook for US players - <a href="https://www.sportsbook.ag/">Sportsbook.ag</a> has the odds for this matchup at New England -3, but the off season signing of Deangelo Williams means the downgrade from Le'Veon Bell won't be near as big as it would have been in Dri Archer was still the backup running back. The <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12639540/new-england-patriots-rb-legarrette-blount-suspended-2015-opener">suspension of Legarrette Blount</a> for this game and the losses of Darrelle Revis, Akeem Ayers, Shane Vereen, Brandon Browner and Kyle Arrington are being overlooked and I don't think the Patriots will be able to win this game, let alone cover by 3 given the high powered Steelers offense which includes all returning starters from last year and also the addition of Sammie Coates.
