    Phoenix coach Alvin Gentry was ejected from the game vs the LA Lakers. During the ejection he had to be restrained by his assistant coaches before leaving the court. Gentry thought the foul on Lou Amundson by Pau Gasol should have been called for a flagrant foul.

    Which it probably should have, not sure if his reaction should have been that intense. But no coach late in the gives me a reason why the Suns lost, so I can cope with it better. But I want to know what would happen if the assistant coaches would have let him go. Would he attack the ref? Would he do the Baseball Manager in the face / kick the dirt routine?

    <strong>Final Score:</strong> Lakers 102, Suns 96
