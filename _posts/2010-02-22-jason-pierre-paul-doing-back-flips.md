    Dude is a freak!

    Jason Pierre Paul is a DE for South Florida and is estimated to go roughly Mid 1st Round in the 2010 NFL Draft. For someone who is 5 foot tall gymnast, 14 back flips in a row might be just "kind of cool". But This is impressive, this guy is 6'6 ~260lbs, he is a beast.

    Not sure how it will translate to NFL success but at least he can try out for the 2012 Olympics if the NFL falls through.
