    <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/2015/02/18/james-harden-houston-rockets-mvp-midseason-report">James Harden</a> is leading MVP candidate according to <a href="https://www.sportsbooknavigator.com/bovada-sportsbook/">Bovada.lv sportsbook review</a>Â as we enter the 3rd third of play. Harden is averaging a league high 27.4 PPG and outpacing his career averages in every other category, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals.
  </p>

  <p>
    LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Steph Curry round out the others in contention for the award this year. <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2015/02/and_everything_else_you_need_t_6.html">LeBron</a> missed some time with a knee injury earlier this season, but since then has come back to be the LeBron we all know and love. If Cleveland can climb back to the 2 seed in the East LeBron can make a good case for MVP.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anthony Davis has made the leap this season into one of the best players in the league, putting up an insane 2.74 blocks per game along with 24.5 PPG and 10.3 RPG, but the lack of another star on the Pelicans will hurt their playoff chances and it's <a href="http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/10/29/anthony-davis-has-zero-chance-of-winning-mvp-this-season/">unlikely a player on a non playoff team will win MVP</a> even if he is putting up the best <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/statistics">PER</a> in recent memory
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.nba.com/2015/news/features/sekou_smith/02/06/week-14-kia-race-to-the-mvp-ladder-stephen-curry-proves-his-doubters-wrong/index.html">Steph Curry</a> should give Harden the biggest challenge averaging 23.6 PPG while shooting 40% from 3 and still averaging 7.9 assists per game. The Warriors are by far the best team out of the 4 with guys contending for the MVP, so it wouldn't surprise me if the Warriors finish 66-16 that Curry takes the MVP based on his team success.
