    This originally aired on 11.2.05, 4 years later the Tiger Woods Sex Scandal was uncovered. Maybe Mike O'Malley was calling Tiger out, maybe he knew. Maybe he was trying to help a friend. All I know is it's funny as hell.

    What else does Yes Dear predict?!?! I never watched the show, does the world end? Do the Vikings win the Super Bowl?!?! Does Favre retire again? Someone needs to put 'Yes Dear' episodes up on Hulu so a scientist / statistician can analyze this fortune telling show.
