<div class="entry">
  <p>
    LeBron James and Chris Paul have both joined twitter. You can follow them as <a href="https://twitter.com/kingjames">@kingjames</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/oneandonlycp3">@Oneandonlycp3</a>. Both accounts have been verified by twitter.
  </p>

  <p>
    LeBron's first tweet was
  </p>

  <p>
    "Hello World, the Real King James is in the Building "Finally". My Brother @<a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/oneandonlycp3">oneandonlycp3</a> gas'd me up to jump on board so I'm here. Haaaa"
  </p>

  <p>
    LeBron's publicist announced that he will NOT be announcing his signing status via twitter and that the account is just for fun.
