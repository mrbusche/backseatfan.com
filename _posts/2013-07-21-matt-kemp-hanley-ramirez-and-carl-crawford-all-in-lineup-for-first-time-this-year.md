  <p>
    Don't look now, but the Los Angeles Dodgers are finally getting healthy. For the first time this year Kemp, Hanley and Crawford are all in the starting lineup. In a weak division they're just 1/2 a game out as of July 21st and Arizona has been faltering as their pitching has struggled the past month.
  </p>

  <p>
    This morning I was checking out places to make <a href="https://www.888sport.com/">free bets</a>Â and it looks like most sites haven't reacted to the improved Dodger lineup. The Dodgers are hitting .283/.338/.432 in July which puts them in the top 10 in each of the categories for the month whereas they had been in the bottom 5 all other months.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Dodgers finish the season with just 29 of their 68 remaining games against teams with records over .500 and that could quickly change if the Diamondback continue their slide. The Dodgers also play a decent number of games at home over the next 6 weeks before ending the season with 10 of their last 13 on the road.
  </p>

  <p>
    The one downside to the Dodgers upcoming schedule is they make four separate trips to the Central and Eastern timezones, which is something we will continue to pay attention to.
