    Video of Texas Rangers Pitcher Dustin Nippert getting hit in the head by a line drive. The ball flew nearly 90 feet after it hit Nippert on the temple. Pretty scary stuff. Luckily he was able to walk away from it. Dustin is listed as day to day and gets a chance to recover from that brutal hit to the head.
