  <p>
    New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, 80, died this morning, around 6:30 AM ET, according to The New York Daily News. Steinbrenner  suffered a massive heart attack last night in Tampa, FL and could not recover.
  </p>

  <p>
    A statement from George Steinbrenner's Family:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      It is with profound sadness that the family of George M. Steinbrenner III announces his passing. He passed away this morning in Tampa, Fla., at age 80,
    </p>

    <p>
      He was an incredible and charitable man. First and foremost he was devoted to his entire family &#8212; his beloved wife, Joan; his sisters, Susan Norpell and Judy Kamm, his children, Hank, Jennifer Jessica and Hal; and all of his grandchildren.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was a visionary and a giant in the world of sports. He took a great but struggling franchise and turned it into a champion again.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The Steinbrenner family will hold private funeral arrangements, but will have a public service as well that will be announced at a later date.
  </p>

  <p>
    George just celebrated his 80th birthday over the  fourth of July weekend, and said he was doing well just a week ago at his Spring Facility.  George is probably one of the best owners ever, the Yankess won 11 AL pennants, and seven World Series titles under his régime.
  </p>

  <p>
    George bought the Yankees for just $10 million dollars, and now the team is worth $1.5-1.6 BILLION.  George Steinbrenner's sons, Hank and Hal took over the team in late 2007.   Hopefully they can continue the Steinbrenner tradition for years to come.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's hard to sum up George Steinbrenner is just one line, but if I had to choose one of his quotes, &#8220;Winning is the most important thing in my life, after breathing. Breathing first, winning next,&#8221; is his best quote.
  </p>

  <p>
    George Steinbrenner is a legend and will be missed by many.
  </p>

  <p>
    RIP George
