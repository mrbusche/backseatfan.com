    Edgerrin James has asked Cardinals General Manager Rod Graves for his release. James is hoping for a quick response since he is already entering the free agent market late, with number of his potential suitors already signing running backs. Tampa Bay, Cincinnati, and New England were considered suitors for James but they have signed Derrick Warn, Cedric Benson and Fred Taylor respectively.
