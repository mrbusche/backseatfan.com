<div class="entry">
  <p>
    There was no trade for San Diego Charger's WR Vincent Jackson.  The 1 pm deadline has passed, and there were no trades to be found.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Vincent Jackson's Agent Jonathan Feinsod: &#8220;Archie Manning had it right. They call (A.J. Smith) 'The Lord of No Rings' for a reason.&#8221;
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Talks between the Chargers and the Vikings fell through.  Minnesota was rumored to be offering the Chargers a 2nd rounder and a conditional draft pick.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jackson will now miss an additional 3 games since he wasn't traded today.  Making him available to play by week 8 if he gets traded.
  </p>

  <p>
    A playoff contender might try to trade for him to use in the 2nd half of the season and a playoff run.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Chargers better get what they can and trade him before the deadline.  I don't know if they will be able to get better than what the Vikings offered them.  Take what you can get, because there is no way in hell you are going to resign him.
