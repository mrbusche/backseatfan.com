<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Houston Texan's linebacker Brian Cushing didn't test positive for steroids, he tested positve for elevated levels of hCG.
  </p>

  <p>
    hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is a banned substance in the NFL, it is used to stimulate the body's testosterone production after an athlete uses anabolic steroids.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a player needs to use hCG for medical reasons they can get an exemption.  If Cushing would of  had an exemption he wouln't be suspended.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cushing said he took the substance in September of 2009, so maybe coming off of a steroid cycle perhaps?!?
  </p>

  <p>
    Cushing took and passed a lie-detector test to prove that he did not take a performance-enhancing drug.  But those things are only 95% accurate, right?  I'm leaning on that 5% chance that he took something.
