  <p>
    NFL over/unders have been released for a while now, but we've yet to write anything up giving our thoughts.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Baltimore Ravens are the defending Super Bowl champion and lost a lot of defensive players this offseason, but reloaded in the secondary free agent market yet somehow have an over/under of 8.5 at most sports betting sites. I'll gladly take the over at -135.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Philadelphia Eagles are projected for just 7.5 wins in 2013 according to <a href="https://www.topbettingaction.com/">TopBettingAction.com sportsbook sites</a> which I feel is too low. Chip Kelly may not turn out to be a great NFL coach, but there's no doubt in my mind he will confuse NFL defenses for at least the first half of the season this year and the Eagles will easily get to 8 wins.
  </p>

  <p>
    The San Francisco 49ers were one red zone possession away from winning the Super Bowl, but they are projected for a whopping 11 wins in 2013. Colin Kaepernick is a great QB, but there's a huge lack of WR's in the Bay Area and with 2 games against Seattle and one each vs Green Bay, Houston, New Orleans, Tampa Bay and Atlanta I don't see how they get to 11 wins in 2013.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Chicago Bears are a perennial team on this list because everyone always thinks they're better than they really are. 8.5 wins for a team that can't pass the ball is crazy. Jay Cutler is routinely the ~20th best QB every year which just isn't going to get it done in a division with Green Bay, Detroit and Minnesota plus they travel to Pittsburgh, Washington and Philadelphia this year and have home games vs Cincinnati, New Orleans, the Giants and the Ravens. Even if Cutler makes a big improvement this year I can't get them to 9 wins.
