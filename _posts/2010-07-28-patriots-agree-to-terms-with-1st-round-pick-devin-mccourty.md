    The New England Patriots and first round pick Devin McCourty have agreed to terms on a five year contract according to his agent, Andy Simms. The contract will have  a maximum value of $13.2 million with $7.825 million guarantees and bonuses.
  </p>

  <p>
    McCourty was the 27th overall pick in 2010 NFL Draft. McCourty was the last of the Patriots' 12 draft picks to agree to a contract. Devin in the 2nd first-round pick to agree to terms; Cowboys WR Dez Bryant signed his rookie deal last week.

  </p>

  <p>
    McCourty's contract is worth about $.4M more than <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2009/05/2009-nfl-draft-rookie-signing-status/">last year's 27th overall pick</a> Donald Brown. McCourty also received $1 million more in guarantees than Brown did.
