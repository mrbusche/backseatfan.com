<div class="entry">
  <p>
    According to <a href="https://twitter.com/SI_JonHeyman/status/6673019520">Sport's Illustrateds Jon Heyman</a> Roy Halladay has been traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in a 3 way deal with the Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays.
  </p>

  <p>
    The trade appears to be Halladay to the Phillies, Cliff Lee to the Mariners and prospects from both teams to the Blue Jays. With The Phillies giving up Cliff Lee I don't see any way they also gave up Kyle Drabek or JA Happ but I guess we will find out.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sources are saying Halladay has agreed to sign a long term extension as part of the deal. The sources are also reporting Halladay has agreed to take a smaller contract than what he could have gotten in free agency to be part of the Phillies. If you are a Phillies fan you have to love hearing that.
  </p>

  <p>
    It has been rumored that Cliff Lee had no interest in signing a long term deal with the Phillies, so this trade makes a lot of sense for the Phillies, they get a player of Lee's caliber if not better and he signs a long term extension.

    <span><span>Aumont is considered an elite prospect and has the potential to develop into a great reliever<br /> </span></span>
