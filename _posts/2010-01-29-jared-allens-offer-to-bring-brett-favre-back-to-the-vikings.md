    During an appearance on the NFL Network, Jared Allen might have provided Brett with a little extra incentive. "Silver fox," Allen said, referring to his 40-year-old teammate. "Everything but my backside loves you, but if you come back, I will let you slap my rear end every single day. In no way gay at all, but I will take that stinging pain and I will eat it every day."

    If Favre had any doubts as to whether or not he was coming back I think this is enough incentive for him to give it one last year.
