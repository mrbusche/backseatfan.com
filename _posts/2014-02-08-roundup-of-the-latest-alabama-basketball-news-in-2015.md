    As many may have noticed, there&rsquo;s been a lot going on recently in the Alabama basketball scene. In case you missed any of the action, here&rsquo;s a quick round up of some of the latest developments both on and off the court.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a start, the Alabama men&rsquo;s group saw a 93-91 loss in their match against Arkanas on 15th January in a match which has been described as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.rolltide.com/sports/m-baskbl/alab-m-baskbl-body.html">Heartbreaking</a>&rdquo; by various sports journalists. The game was obviously very close, so it was a frustrating evening for players and fans alike. However, the players still have plenty to be proud of &ndash; particularly Justin Coleman, a Freshman who managed to bag an incredible 22 points, all in the second half.

However, the success was partly marred by an ugly fight which broke out towards the end of the first half, in which 3 players, Alabama&rsquo;s Breanna Hayden and Meoshonti Knight, as well as the Tiger&rsquo;s Hasina Muhammad, had to be sent off. It is unclear as of yet what exactly caused the fight, but the punches were thrown shortly after a free throw in which Muhammad and Hayden became entangled.

    And there was some sad news for players on the Alabama A&M team as James Wright, the assistant men&rsquo;s basketball coach, died at the age of just 46. It has been confirmed by a coroner that he died naturally of cardiopulmonary causes. Wright was greatly respected within the sports industry, having also acted as a senior director for both the Mo Williams and Lindsey Hunter Basketball camps, and there is no doubt that he will be missed by colleagues and students alike.
