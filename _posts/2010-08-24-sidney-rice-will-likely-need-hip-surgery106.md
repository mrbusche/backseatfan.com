<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Minnesota Vikings WR Sidney Rice traveled to Vail, Colorado on Monday to visit a hip specialist and the <em><a href="https://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/101351219.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiU9PmP:QiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU">Star-Tribune</a><span style="font-style: normal;">'s Judd Zulgad is</span></em> reporting that surgery is likely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Surgery would likely sideline Rice at least the first 8 games of the season. Drew Rosenhaus, Rice's agent and Vikings' officials did not return messages from Zulgad. Rice has been on the PUP list since training camp opened because of the injury suffered in the Vikings' loss to New Orleans last January.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two of three specialists who examined Rice's hip during the off-season recommended surgery, but Rice chose not to have the surgery.
  </p>

  <p>
    There had been rumors swirling that Rice was not rushing back because he was unhappy with the $550,000 he was scheduled to receive this season, the final year of his rookie deal.

  <p>
    UPDATE: According to <a href="https://twitter.com/chipscoggins/statuses/21999406230">Chip Scoggins</a> of the Star Tribune Rice had hip surgery today and it 'went well'.
