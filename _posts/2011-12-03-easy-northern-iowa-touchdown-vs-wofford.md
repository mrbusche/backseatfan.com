  <p>
    Wofford and UNI are in the second round of the playoffs, so everyone is ready to play, right? Wrong. Wofford Returner, Stephon Shelton, forgot to take a knee after a 70 yard kick in the endzone. Shen has the ball knocked out of his hand while he walks towards the sidelines, and fumbles. Phil Wright jumps on the fumble in the endzone for a Touchdown.

  <p>
    Needless to say, it was the Easiest touchdown that Northern Iowa has ever scored.
  </p>

  <p>
    Northern Iowa won the game 28-21.
