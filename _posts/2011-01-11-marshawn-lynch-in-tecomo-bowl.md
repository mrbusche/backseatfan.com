    Another spin off of Marshawn Lynch's giant run vs the Saints, this one is just as good as the <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2011/01/marshawn-lynch-in-super-mario-brothers/">Super Mario</a> run. Â Doesn't it make you want another version of Tecmo Bowl? Pretty sure anything could beat madden right about now, as long as it had the real players.
