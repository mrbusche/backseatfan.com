<div class="entry">
  <p>
    The Minnesota Vikings have finally fired head coach Brad Childress. Defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier has been named interim head coach for the remainder of the 2010 season.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was originally reported this morning that Childress would have his regularly scheduled weekly press conference, which led to speculation his job was safe.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jay Glazer of FOX Sports was the <a href="https://twitter.com/Jay_Glazer/status/6755156213366784">first to report</a> the news and the Vikings have since confirmed the news.
  </p>

  <p>
    It will be interesting to see if Frazier makes the change at QB that some fans have been looking for. At this point in the season there is no reason to have Brett Favre still starting.
