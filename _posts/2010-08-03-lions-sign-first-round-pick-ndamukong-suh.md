  <p>
    According to <a href="http://bit.ly/cC2yaz ">@Adam_Schefter</a> the Detroit Lions have reached a deal with 1st round pick Ndamukong Suh. That leaves only 2 first rounders left to sign in this years draft class.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suh agreed to a  5 Year, $60M (MAX $68M); $40M G deal with the Detroit Lions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 2nd pick overall out of Nebraska should make an immediate impact on the Lions, it is a good thing he finally got into camp.  He is like Albert Haynesworth but is in shape, has work ethic, and will be a lot better than him.  So really, nothing like Haynesworth.
