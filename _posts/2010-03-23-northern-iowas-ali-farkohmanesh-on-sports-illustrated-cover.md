    Good press for Northern Iowa but bad news for Northern Iowa. The Sports Illustrated cover jinx went 3 for 6 last week, Â Gonzaga, Kansas and Villanova eliminated from the tournament. Although, someone did have to lose the Gonzaga vs Syracuse game. <a href="/images/2010/03/farokhmanesh.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4849" title="unknown" src="/images/2010/03/farokhmanesh-226x300.jpg" alt="unknown" width="226" height="300" srcset="/images/2010/03/farokhmanesh-226x300.jpg 226w, /images/2010/03/farokhmanesh-773x1024.jpg 773w, /images/2010/03/farokhmanesh.jpg 1219w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" /></a>
