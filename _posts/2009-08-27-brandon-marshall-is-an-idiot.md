    Brandon Marshall has gone and done the unthinkable. He's made it clear to every other team in the NFL he doesn't care. Check out this <a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/video/20590420/index.html">video</a> from Denver channel 7 news. Marshall is shown walking during running drills, batting down passes as they're thrown to him, and even punts a ball instead of handing it to a ball boy.

    This is absolutely disgusting, I can't imagine any team in the NFL watching this video and thinking, "Hey, a 1st round pick and a 4th? For this guy? Sign me up!" It's only a matter of time before the Broncos suspend Marshall for conduct detrimental to the team, then he'll have even less money than he does now. I'm surprised no one on the team has stepped up and told him to quit acting like a toddler. On a team filled with a lot of young players and not many veterans (that have been on the Broncos for multiple years), I'm not sure <em>who</em> should step up. Champ Bailey and Brian Dawkins are two that come to mind, but they have never been known as guys who like to speak up.

    It's a shame, a guy who could be a top 5 wide receiver in the league has chosen to act like a 3 year old. Here's to hoping the Broncos suspend him and he starts acting at least half of his 25 years of age.
