    <br /> NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen - Cornell vs Kentucky Wildcats Highlights.
  </p>

  <p>
    #1 Kentucky was too much for the #12 Cornell Big Red. It was a good story for Cornell, they were the Cinderella of the tournament, but they couldn't keep up with the Wildcats in this game. Kentucky moves on to the elite 8 with a final score of 62 - 45
