    LA Clippers' Chris Kaman loves fireworks, $10k dollars worth of fireworks. Kaman makes $12 Million a year, so $10k seems like $100 dollars to him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why does he like fireworks so much? Maybe he just really loves to celebrate the 4th of July with his friends and family.
  </p>

    OK, the real reason he loves fireworks is because he loves to blow shit up. Using a butane torch as a lighter Kaman and his friends blew up $10k dollars worth of fireworks on the 4th of July. Having your friends light a bundle of giant fireworks bombs then run as fast as you can is just ridiculously stupid, and ridiculously fun to watch.

    Chris entertained his friends in Western Michigan, blew some shit up, probably ruined part of his truck/trailer, and broke some laws. All in the name of America.
