    The Kansas City Chiefs got the steal of the year with the Matt Cassel trade. Matt Cassel could have easily gone for multiple picks. But he didn't. He went for a 2nd round pick, and he was paired with veteran linebackerMike Vrabel. The math just doesn't add up.

  <p>
    Matt Cassel = 1st round pick + 3rd round pick
  </p>

  <p>
    Matt Cassel + Mike Vrabel = 2nd round pick???????
  </p>

  <p>
    I understand the Patriot's concept of having a 2nd round pick, its less expensive, and they have had good production out of the 2nd rounders. I also see how Vrabel was added on to get rid of some cap space but he is still worth another pick at least.Is it too much to ask for a 4th rounder? 5th? 6th? or even 7th? I mean seriously ONLY a 2nd rounder for an offensive leader and a defensive leader? Ridiculous. There is some risk involved for the Chiefs, Cassel could be a one year wonder, but the risk of a 2nd round pick is just as risky. At least Cassel has proved something at the NFL level.If I was a Patriot's fan I would feel pretty screwed about the whole deal.

    <strong>Final Thought</strong>

    Patriots Losers<br /> Chiefs Winners

  <p>
    If I was a fan of the Patriots I would feel pretty screwed, and if I were a Chiefs fan I would be pretty happy with the trade.

    What do the fans out there think?
