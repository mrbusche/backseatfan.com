    Pete Carroll is shocked about the USC Sanctions that were placed upon his former team by the NCAA. He plans on supporting the Trojans, and helping out the best he can.

    Maybe he knew nothing, maybe he knew it all. It is halfway suspicious that Carroll left USC and later that year these sanctions came out. I didn't really like Lane Kiffin, but I feel sorry for him. He probably thought he would lose a few scholarships to this investigation, but 30 is pretty ridiculous.

    USC is the example school, and they needed to throw the hammer down. Maybe it will cause other schools to clean up their programs a little bit.
