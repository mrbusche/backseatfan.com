    Video of Vince Young fighting at a Strip Club was released today. Young received a Class C misdemeanor for assault, which is about the same as a speeding ticket. The NFL is looking into the incident, he might get fined, and I doubt he will get suspended.

    Apparently an upside down longhorn is &#8220;fight'n words&#8221;, I never knew that. I'm sure Longhorns fans will be seeing more of it now.

    Here's what you should do Vince, don't assault anyone. Pay someone in your posse be the enforcer.
