    Ali Farokhmanesh drains a 3 pointer vs Kansas to secure the win for Northern Iowa. This shot was ballsy, he could have wasted time, but he drove in the dagger.

    As a UNI alumni I am pumped that the Panthers are finally getting some respect. I almost pissed myself after he threw up the three pointer. But I am glad he did it, and I am proud to be a Panther!
