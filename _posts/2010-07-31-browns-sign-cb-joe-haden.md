    The Cleveland Browns have signed first round draft pick Joe Haden to a 5 year $50 million (max value) deal with $26 million guaranteed. Included in the $26 million guaranteed is a <a href="http://twitter.com/JasonLaCanfora/statuses/20005737780">$12 million signing bonus</a>.

    With the signing Haden's &#8220;holdout&#8221; will last just half a day. The CB is expected to practice this afternoon.

  <p>
    Haden is now one of the top paid cornerbacks in the league and it's likely he won't start this year being stuck behind Eric Wright and Sheldon Brown. Haden's speed and ability to become a true #1 quarterback has been questioned since he announced he was entering this year's draft.
