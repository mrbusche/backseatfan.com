    Bud Adams is one Angry Old Man. What a great gesture by Bud Adams. He has a ton of class, and it makes me want to be a fan of the Titans. At least the owner has passion. Come on Ziggy, flip of the Packers fans or the Bears fan. Show some Passion.

    He only got fined $250,000. Chump Change for Buddy.
