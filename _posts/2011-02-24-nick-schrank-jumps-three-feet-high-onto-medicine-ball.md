    UFL Virginia Destroyers LB prospect Nick Schrank has found a better viral video to help promote him and the UFL. He jumps 32 inches, on to a medicine ball. Ridiculous. I think his eye if fine people.

    UFL could be gaining some new fans if there is an NFL lockout. They should probably produce some viral videos like this.
