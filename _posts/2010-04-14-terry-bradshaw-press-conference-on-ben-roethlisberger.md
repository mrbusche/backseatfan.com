    Terry Bradshaw had a nice talk about Ben Roethlisberger and his current situation. Bradshaw gave Big Ben some advice, and it doesn't sound like he took any of it. Basically, Rothlisberger is a douche bag. He doesn't know how to act like an intelligent person, and has no idea what position he is in. Roethlisberger has a lot of growing up to do, maybe he can still recover his image.
