  <h2>
    Sleepers
  </h2>

  <h3>
    Quarterback
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Matt Ryan - Falcons: </strong> Tony Gonzalez was added during the off-season, he is still a top TE, and can easily get 1000 yards and 8 TDS this year. Justin Peele was the TE last year. I see a lot of improvement here. Ryan should have a solid year, I don't see any drop off, it is an easy pick in the later rounds.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Kyle Orton - Broncos:</strong> This is the first time in his NFL career where he has had 2 legit WRs. He should be on the board late and he is worth getting as a backup QB to see how he produces.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Running back
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Pierre Thomas - Saints: </strong> With Duece gone Pierre should be getting the majority of the every down carries. He should also be getting the majority of the goal line carries. Plus Reggie Bush is injury prone, and can not be an every down back. So if he Bush goes down, it is all on Thomas.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Darren McFadden - Raiders: </strong>Two things that make McFadden a sneaky sleeper, he had turf toe pretty much most of last year, so his stats look horrible, and he plays for the Raiders. He had a few breakout games last year, and I see him breaking out this year and eventually getting the majority of the carries. And we all know that the Raiders have no QB, so all they are going to do is run. Wing-T anyone?
  </p>

  <h3>
    Wide Receiver
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Anquan Boldin - Cardinals -</strong> He didn't play in 4 games last year due to injury and he still put up monster stats. And let's face it, he isn't going to shatter his face every year. I can see him doing just as good as Fitzgerald, but is being drafted 20 picks later (29th ADP vs Fitzgeralds 9th). Even if he get's traded he should be a beast.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Anthony Gonzalez - Colts: </strong>With starvin' Marvin Harrison gone, it looks like Gonzalez is the #2 WR now. He should get some good looks since Wayne will be the main problem for the defenses. He is projected in the later rounds, so he should be a great steal.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Steve Breaston - Cardinals: </strong>For a late round flier, you get a great deal. A 1000 yard receiver last year, and 3 TDs, this is pretty good considering you can snatch him up in the late rounds. And if Boldin get's traded he is the #2 guy.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Tight End
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Greg Olson - Bears: </strong>Cutler needs to throw to somebody, might as well be the Bear's best receiver.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Kevin Boss - Giants: </strong>Eli only has a few targets this year, and Boss is one of them. I can see him getting a lot more looks, especially since their is no Burress and no Toomer.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Busts
  </h2>

  <h3>
    Quarterback
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Tony Romo - Cowboys: </strong>I do not like what I see in Dallas this year. Romo has no #1 WR to throw to with TO gone. I don't like Roy Williams being his #1, I think it will be a very run heavy offense this year. If you can get Romo late, go for him, but I do not think he is a top QB this year.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Chad Pennington - Dolphins: </strong>Pennington when into last year in F you mode. He wanted to stick it to the Jets, and he did. This year I think we will just be mediocre, just like a normal year with the Jets. There are going to be too many different people touching the ball to make him a huge fantasy threat.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Running Back
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Thomas Jones - Jets: </strong> Jones had a monster year last year, but I don't think there will be a repeat this year. He is 31, and disgruntled about his contract. The Jets traded up in the draft to get Doak Walker Award winning running back Shonn Greene. And Rex Ryan said he planned on using him. Does Baltimore's 3-headed running back trio sound familiar? Take some pressure of the rookie QB perhaps? He might start out the year getting more carries, but it is a new era in New York, and Shonn Greene will come out on top.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Ronnie Brown - Dolphins: </strong>Half of his touchdowns last year were against New England when they unleashed the wildcat (Wild-tuna) offense. He is a good back, but he will be splitting time with Ricky Williams, and for some reason, not sure why, I have this itching feeling that Pat White will be running some of those wildcat(wild-tuna) formations. Once Williams is gone, he will be a solid fantasy pick again. Just wait for the first couple drug tests to go through.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Wide Receiver
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Roy Williams - Cowboys: </strong>He didn't do good along side TO last year, and he didn't do good along side Calvin Johnson, I don't think he is going to do good alongside Patrick Crayton. He isn't a true #1 receiver, and he is no replacement for TO. 430 Yards and 2 TDs is not #1 WR numbers. If you are looking for a #1 receiver out of Dallas, look for Jason Witten.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Micheal Crabtree - 49ers: </strong>Sign your god damn contract already. You are not a top 5 pick, just because you were projected to be one, doesn't mean you should get paid like one. Don't cry to us that you aren't making 35 million when you are making 20 million. I think you can survive. He is missing most of training camp, and rookie WR usually don't do the best their first year. Especially when you cry about your contract.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Tight End
  </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Kellen Winslow - Bucs:</strong> Not really sure if he is going to stay healthy, or if he is going to bust out, but there is not enough reward with the risk to take him as a #1 TE. If you can get him in the later rounds thats fine, but whos throwing to him?
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Vernon Davis - 49ers:</strong> Don't draft him on his &#8220;potential&#8221;, people will draft him way to high. He is a backup fantasy tight end, don't touch him until the later rounds. Singletary likes winners, plus he made Davis cry. So Davis isn't on his good side.
