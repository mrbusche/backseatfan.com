  <p>
    The Philadelphia entered the bottom of the 8th down 7 runs and in danger of falling 3 games behind first place Atlanta in the NL East. In the 8th and 9th innings 4 Dodgers pitchers combined to give up 8 runs (7 earned) and record just 3 outs.

  <p>
    Broxton blew his fifth save the season and continued his struggles against the Phillies which date back to game 4 of the 2008 NLCS.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clayton Kershaw gave up 2 runs in 6 2/3 innings but got the no decision, the Dodgers aren't quite out of the playoff race yet, but with this loss fall 6.5 games behind the Giants in the Wild Card race and also fall behind Colorado for 5th in the Wild Card standings.
