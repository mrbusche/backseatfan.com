    Anthony Robles of Arizona State won the NCAA wrestling National Championship at 125 lbs vs. Matt McDonough of Iowa.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a really inspiring story, Anthony Robles was born with only one leg and has won a National Championship. Anthony started wrestling his freshman year in high school, with no prior wrestling experience. He has worked his way up to a National Championship. He outscored his oppenents in the NCAA tournament 52-7, which is ridiculous!

    <strong>Here is a great profile on his journey to a championship.<br /> </strong><br />
  </p>

  <p>
    Anthony has earned this championship. People might say he has an advantage because he only has one leg, but I don't see it that way. There are a million different types of wrestlers, he is just one of them.

    <strong>Great Job Anthony!<br /> </strong>
