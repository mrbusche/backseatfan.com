    Chyladin over at theÂ <a href="https://www.arrowheadpride.com/" target="_blank">Kansas City Chiefs</a> blog Arrowhead Pride wrote up a great article about Eric Berry and his interaction with the some young fans after practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    The youngsters had a football and hat that Berry signed and after being informed earlier that players sometimes give away their gloves they asked Berry for his gloves. Berry informed them he had unfortunately already given away his gloves earlier. What happened next may shock every football fan. Berry took off his shoes, signed them, and handed them to the kids.

  <p>
    It looks like the Chiefs drafted not only a guy with tremendous upside but a guy with great character as well.
