    <br /> <strong>Georgia Tech vs N.C. State - 2006<br /> </strong>Ridiculous catch by Calvin Johnson when he played for Georgia Tech. What makes the catch even better is that he was only a freshman. He is just a beast, I think he is going to have a phenomenal season with the Detroit Lions this year.
