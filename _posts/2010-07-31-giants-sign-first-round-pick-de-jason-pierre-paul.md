  <p>
    The New York Giants have signed first round draft pick Jason Pierre-Paul to a <a href="http://twitter.com/Adam_Schefter/statuses/20028495690">five-year contract</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The deal is worth 20,050,000 with $11,629,807 guaranteed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pierre-Paul is a raw but extremely talented and athletic player, he will likely see limited time as a rookie, but has the potential to beat a star.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pierre-Paul's signing should help Earl Thomas and Derrick Morgan get under contract.
  </p>
