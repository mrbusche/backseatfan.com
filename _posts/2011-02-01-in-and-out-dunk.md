    This "dunk" is ridiculous. Â The ball clearly goes in the basket and flings out of the basket on its own during the Kansas vs Kansas State game. The ruling on the court is no basket. Ridiculous. I say if the ball passes the rim, it should count. It was 3/4 of the way through the hoop! They could at least get 3/4 of a point!
