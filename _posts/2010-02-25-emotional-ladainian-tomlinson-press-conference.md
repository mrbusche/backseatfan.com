    LaDainian Tomlinson was released by the Chargers this week after 9 seasons. Here is the press conference thanking San Diego, his fans, and his teammates. He gets really emotional, which I don't blame him, he loved playing for San Diego. Big Football players can cry too.

    So where will LT land? Rumors have been flying everywhere, and he could land on any team as a starter, or a complimentary back (I can't call him a backup). One possible destination that is pretty intriguing is the Saints, which would reunite him with Drew Brees.
