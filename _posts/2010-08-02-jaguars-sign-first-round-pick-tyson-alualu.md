    The Jacksonville Jaguars have signed their first round selection Tyson Alualu. There has been a 5 day holdout, and some controversy on if Alualu's agent agrees with the deal or not. But it has finally been agreed upon.
  </p>

  <p>
    The contract is a 5 year $28 million and includes more than $17.5 million guaranteed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 10th overall pick out of Cal is expected to make an impact with the Jags, replacing John Henderson, who the Jaguars released earlier this year.
