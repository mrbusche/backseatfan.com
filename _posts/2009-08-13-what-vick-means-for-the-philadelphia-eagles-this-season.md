What impact does this have on the Eagles? A very positive impact. Vick wasn't looking for a team that would let him play right away, he was looking for a team with stability. With coach Andy Reid, General Manager Tom Heckert, and President Joe Banner it's hard to find a more stable organization in the NFL (Patriots are the only one that comes to mind).

    Vick will be eligible to play in the final 2 preseason games and I expect he will get a lot of snaps in those 2 games, especially since he will be out until at least Week 6.

    I would assume Reid, Heckert, and Banner consulted with McNabb and the rest of the team before making this signing. McNabb is nearing the end of his career and is still seeking that elusive Super Bowl win, Vick would certainly give the Eagles one of the best offenses in the NFL.

    I don't think Vick plays as quarterback in the Eagles offense though. McNabb likes being the star and you all saw how he reacted after being benched against the Ravens last year, imagine what he would do if he were removed for 6-10 plays a game? Vick would make a great slot receiver or wildcat back in the Eagles offense and I think they will utilize him as so.

    Expect Vick to play a large role in the backfield, especially on first down. He has averaged 7.6 yards per carry on first down in his career, far and away the best of any active player, 2.3 yards more than the average of Frank Gore.

    Vick missing the first few weeks of the season may turn out to be a blessing for Vick, it's hard to imagine he is currently in football shape and it prevents the Eagles from being in a tough position of whether to put a 75% game ready Vick on the field.

    The Eagles signed Vick and what is basically a no risk contract. $1.6M the first season and an option for the second year at $5.2M, with nothing guaranteed.
