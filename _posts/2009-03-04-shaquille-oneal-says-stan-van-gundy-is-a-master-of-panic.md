    Shaquille O'Neal ripped his former coach, Stan Van Gunday today after comments made about O'Neal flopping last night in the Suns loss to the Magic.
  </p>

  <p>
    "I heard his comment. Flopping to me is doing it more than one time, and I realized when I tried to take the charge, as I went down, I realized that that play reminded me of his whole coaching career," O'Neal said of Van Gundy. "And one thing I really despise is a front runner, so I know for a fact that he's a master of panic, and when it gets time for his team to go in the postseason and do certain things, he will let them down because of his panic. I've been there before, I've played for him."

    <span>Shaq also added, "I've done more than him, his brother and Patrick Ewing. "Stan Van Gundy reminds me of a broke navigational system. He knows everything about everything but ain't never been nowhere."</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    Van Gundy coached shack for 104 games in his Heat career, before Pat Riley replaced him in 2005, the season Miami won the championship. O'Neal was vocal of his dislike for Van Gundy while in Miami and was often credited, or blamed, depending whose side you are on, with Riley replace Van Gundy 22 games into the season.

    After his initial rant O'Neal stopped an ESPN.com reporter and said he wanted to make sure one additional quote was printed: "Now I see why everybody who plays for him doesn't like him."

    This transgression was inspried after Howard put an elbow in O'Neal's chest and O'Neal feel to the ground. "I said I flopped, but flopping is falling and crying and complaining to the ref. I tried to take a charge. Te rules say when a guy comes into your chest and you fall, that's an offensive foul, and that's all I tried to do. I fell and I didn't complain. Dwight made a great move, but flopping is the wrong choice of words."

    Do you think O'Neal contradicted what he has been so against in his <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2011/07/top-major-league-baseball-players-outside-the-u-s/">career</a><br /> ? Do you think his flop was in any way similar to the flops Vlade Divac was famous for? Let us know in the comments section.
