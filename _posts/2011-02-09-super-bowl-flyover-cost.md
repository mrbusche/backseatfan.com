  <p>
    How much did the Super Bowl flyover cost? Just about $109,000, but it is already included in the budget.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Air Force completed flyovers for 275 sporting events in 2010, which is only 27 percent of all of their flyovers.
  </p>

    The Air Force considers them a training mission, which helps justify the cost.  But they also have another aspect in doing them, recruiting.  I mean, for a 30 second commercial it would cost the Air Force millions of dollars.  But they got a few seconds of fame for a fraction of the cost.  That is good marketing!

  <p>
    I saw a Blue Angels fly by in Telluride, Colorado over the 4th of July last year.  It was probably one of the coolest things I have ever seen. Although they were headed towards a mountain, pulled up, and did some sweet moves

    I'm all for flyovers, if you don't like them, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg9B7V_sKc8">Ricky Stanzi probably has something to say to you.</a>
