<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Tony Tatum of Galludet University makes a sick play that leads to an interception. Tatum does an alley-op type lateral, while jumping out of bounds, to his teammate Shelby Bean. Â Hard to tell if he was in bounds or out of bounds by the angle, but either way it was valiant effort.
