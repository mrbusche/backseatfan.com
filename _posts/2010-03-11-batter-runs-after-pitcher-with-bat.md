    You really have to watch out for who you hit know a days.  Some guys are all roided out, and will go after you with a bat.  Pitchers need to realize, you throw a beanball, you could get bean-batted.   Notice how all of his teammate run away from the guy with the bat, except for the outfielder who stands up for the pitcher.  Sorry that this camera man is terrible.
