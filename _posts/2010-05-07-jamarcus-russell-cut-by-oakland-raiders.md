    The Oakland Raiders released former No. 1 overall pick JaMarcus Russell on Thursday, after three years of horrendous football.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jason Campbell will take over in Oakland, and Russell will probably find a job as a backup QB  somewhere.  Some coach will think he can save Russell, or make him into some sort of project, or a lineman.
  </p>

  <p>
    This will probably go down as the biggest bust in NFL history, he will join the elite group of NFL busts including Ryan Leaf, Ki-Jana Carter, Akili Smith.  No other #1 pick overall was ever released this early in their career.
  </p>

  <p>
    JaMarcus Russell was paid more than $39 million by the Raiders for having the ability to throw 70 yards from one knee. They now know that throwing a football from one knee does not determine how good you are at quarterback.  Russell has been paid about $5 million per win, or about $2 million per passing touchdown.
  </p>

  <p>
    The quote that will always be remembered was when Al Davis fired Lane Kiffin and read a letter to Kiffin in a press conference:
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>"He is a great player. Get over it and coach this team on the field. That is what you were hired to do. We can win with this team."</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    But Al Davis' team wasn't great, it was terrible, and it started with his crappy Quarterback.  Here are a few numbers to sum up how terrible JaMarcus Russell is:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Record as a starter was 7-25
    </li>
    <li>
      52.1 completion percentage
    </li>
    <li>
      18 touchdowns, 23 interceptions
    </li>
    <li>
      15 lost fumbles
    </li>
    <li>
      Passer rating of 65.2
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    JaMarcus Russell's legacy in Oakland will not be forgotten.  He might get the chance to redeem himself on some other team, but he will always be terrible JaMarcus Russell to me.
