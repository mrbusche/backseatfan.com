  <p>
    New Mexico Lobo's coach Steve Alford swears at BYU's Jonathan Tavernari.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Tavernari was involved in a physical altercation near the end of the game with New Mexico's Darington Hobson and had to be restrained.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alford said Monday in a Mountain West teleconference that the conflict was later resolved, and that Tavernari came to the Lobos' locker room and apologized.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alford said he was trying to congratulate Tavernari, a senior, on an outstanding career at BYU, but that the player "didn't want to hear that at the time." Alford said he has called BYU coach Dave Rose to apologize.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Good to know that Steve Alford is still a dick. He was one when he was a coach at Iowa, and hasn't quit since he left. Good Job Steve-o, stay classy.
