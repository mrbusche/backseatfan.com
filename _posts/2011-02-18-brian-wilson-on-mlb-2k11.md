    Brian Wilson is a game player, a winner, and a beastly pitcher. He also has style with all of that game and it shows in the upcoming MLB 2K11. Just incase you were wondering, the beard is in the game. I know I am going to try to win my cool million with Brian Wilson.

    The digital Brian Wilson has just as much personality as the real one. I'm just wondering if the beard will grow longer during the season. Oh and both digital Brian and real Brian&#8230; I am winning the million dollars.

    You can see the difference in beard length between this year and last year. Much better this year, really brings the whole beard-sona.
