    Will Ferrell is Billy Ray &#8220;Rojo&#8221; Johnson the Vennezuelan ex-con baseball pitcher with a sweet stache, who plays for the Round Rock Express, a AAA affiliate for the Houston Astros. He manged to throw one pitch before running off with his 6 pack of beer. Sure that pitch was way off, but he was just testing him, he was going to come with the heat next time. Great bit by Ferrell, can't wait for this to spin off into a movie. Ferrell has done NASCAR and basketball, baseball has to be next, there hasn't been a good baseball movie in a long time. <a href="/images/2010/05/rojo1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5677" title="rojo1" src="/images/2010/05/rojo1.jpg" alt="rojo1" width="420" height="560" srcset="/images/2010/05/rojo1.jpg 420w, /images/2010/05/rojo1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></a>
