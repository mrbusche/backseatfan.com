    Michael Vick will be fully reinstated into the league and eligible to play in Week 3, according to Pro Football Talk. This is good news for the Phildelphia Eagles and Michael Vick. Hopefully Vick can put his past behind him and become a better person on and off the field. The Eagles will be happy to have their secret weapon. The biggest loser in all of this is the Chiefs. They are the first team that will have to face Vick in a real game. If they even use him, they probably won't need to against the Chiefs.

They are the first team that will have to face Vick in a real game. If the Eagles even use Vick that game, they probably won't need to because it is only against the Chiefs. I can't wait to see a play action to Michael Vick and having Vick roll left and Mcnabb roll right. Defenses aren't going to know what to do or how to defend that. It will be interesting to see if Vick breaks the rhythm of the Eagle's offense or just fits right in. The Eagles just need to use him as another weapon, and not just a gimmick.
