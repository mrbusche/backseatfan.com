  <p>
    PETA is looking for a spot to put up a billboard for a new ad that features Tiger Woods in in Windermere, FL (which is near Orlando, FL).
  </p>

  <p>
    The bill board will say "Too Much Sex Can Be a Bad Thing ? For Little Tigers Too. Help Keep Your Cats (and Dogs) Out of Trouble: Always Spay or Neuter!"
  </p>

  <p>
    Woods is not affiliated with PETA and has not endorsed the ad.
  </p>

  <p>
    They might have trouble finding a local advertiser for the Billboard, but chances are it will be up soon.
