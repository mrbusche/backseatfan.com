  <p>
    The Seattle Seahawks have reached a deal with 14th overall pick, S Earl Thomas from Texas.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adam Schefter of ESPN reports the <a href="https://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5427695">contract is worth $21.1 million</a> over 5 years with $12.32 million guaranteed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The signing leaves the Seahawks with just T Russell Okung to sign and 9 total players left unsigned. 8 first rounders and 1 second rounder.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the 5th and 7th rounder signed, Okung has a salary slot set for him, so it shouldn't be long before he signs. Eric Berry got <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2010/07/chiefs-sign-first-round-pick-eric-berry/">$34 million guaranteed</a> from Kansas City as the fifth pick. And seventh-overall choice Joe Haden received <a href="https://backseatfan.com/2010/07/browns-sign-cb-joe-haden/">$26 million</a> from Cleveland.
