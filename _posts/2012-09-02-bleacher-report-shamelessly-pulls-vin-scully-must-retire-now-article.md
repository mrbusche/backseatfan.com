<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Earlier today <a href="http://twitter.com/bleacherreport">Bleacher Report</a>Â published an article title <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1320164-los-angeles-dodgers-vin-scully-must-retire-now">Vin Scully Must Retire Now</a>. I'm not a person who reads Bleacher Report, but it was in the news recently for being acquired for <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/08/06/bleacher-reports-and-the-evolution-of-the-content-farm/">$175 million</a>! Who knew that writing up short two paragraphs articles on the days big news was worth so much money?
  </p>

  <p>
    Back to the article - I have no issues with someone saying someone should retire, especially if that person is past their prime, but to write a full article and only say "he's old" as reasons he should retire is an article written only to draw attention. Now users will go to bleacher report and search for the article, driving those page views their advertisers, so desperately care about.

  <p>
    Do all of us a favor, never read Bleacher Report again and especially don't click through their 22 page slideshow of "<a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1286291-fantasy-football-2012-the-20-best-fantasy-football-team-names-of-2012">best fantasy football team names</a>"
