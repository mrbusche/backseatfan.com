<div class="entry">
  <p>
    The San Diego Chargers moved up from pick 28 to pick 12 to select Fresno State RB Ryan Mathews.
  </p>

  <p>
    To move up that far, the Chargers must have been convinced that someone was set to take Mathews in the next few picks.  Our best guess would be Seattle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mathews is a one-cut downhill runner - just like Norv Turner likes.  He's a three down back that can immediately carry the load, keeping <a style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none !important; font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.rotoworld.com/content/playerpages/player_main.aspx?sport=NFL&id=3221">Darren Sproles</a> in a third-down role.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're still waiting to hear the trade terms.
