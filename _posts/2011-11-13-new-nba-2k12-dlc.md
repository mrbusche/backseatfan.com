<div class="entry">
  <p>
    NBA 2k12 has some cool new downloadoable content coming out November 29th. This new content features over 100 NBA greats / legendary players and new game modes.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few of the Legendary Players to be included in the DLC pack will be Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Dr. J, and the great Larry Bird.
  </p>

  <p>
    The new game modes are in a New York setting and include pick up games from 1 on 1 to 5 on 5, and the great game of HORSE. It should be a great addition to an already great game.
  </p>

  <p>
    The download will be available on PS3 for 9.99 and on Xbox 360 for 800 MS points.
