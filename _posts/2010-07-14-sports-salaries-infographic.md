    This shows the spread of salaries across different sports, mainly concentrates on soccer salaries, and lack there of.  I wonder why they didn't include the WNBA?  Where the average salary is a whopping 40k a year. If you want to grow up to just be an average pro player in something, try to be an average pro player in basketball.
