<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Jordan Spriggs, an Auburn football player sent out a tweet yesterday that said &#8220;man who is good at writing papers?????????????? i pay&#8230;&#8221;Â (Judging from the tweet, I already know that he isn't good at writing papers).
  </p>

  <p>
    Two of his teammates immediately call him an idiot.
  </p>

  <p>
    His Twitter account no longer exists, but whatever you put on the internet is permanent.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am 100% sure he is going to say that his account got hacked.
