    When Steve Nash signed on with CBS Sports he thought he would get the red carpet treatment on his way to South Africa. Looks like CBS screwed him over (just like they screwed all of us when we wanted to watch our team during NCAA Tournament). No Private Jet, No first Class, No Coach. Just a box. But hey, at least he got there safely. Have fun in South Africa Steve.
