<div class="entry">
  <p>
    Ichiro was going for a foul ball and accidently elbowed this girl in the face.  Ignoring the pain, the girl gets this crazed look in her eye and starts to giggle after she realized Ichiro touched her.  She then proceeds to call her mom and every single person that she knows.
