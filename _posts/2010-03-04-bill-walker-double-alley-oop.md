    <br /> Bill Walker of New York Knicks has a great reverse dunk off an oop by Sergio Rodriguez vs Detroit Pistons. Not sure if you can call it a double alley-oop, but I am, Sergio was in the air when he caught/threw the pass back to walker. Therefore it's a Double Alley-Oop.

    Why wouldn't LeBron James want to play for the New York Knicks?!?! Oh, he could play with better players elsewhere? Well, I wouldn't want to play for the Knicks either.
