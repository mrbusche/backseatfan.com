  <p>
    There has been a lot of talk this season about how Dustin Pedroia is in a season long slump. Anyone who has been this assertion has not crunched the numbers between his first 73 games last year and his first 73 game this year

  <p>
    Pedroia's stats have not decreased in any category except home runs, RBI, and Caught Stealing, but Pedroia has also attemped nearly 3 times as many steals as last year. He is ahead of his 2008 pace is runs, 2B, BB and SB. Pedroia has been a strong second half player so his projected 2009 totals will probably be understated but are pretty close to pace with his 2008 numbers, aside from the power.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you crunch the numbers Pedroia is having a <em>better</em> season through 73 games than he had through 73 games in 2008 when he was MVP of the American League.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fantasy Advice</span><br /> If you are in a fantasy league I would target Pedroia as a strong buy low candidate. The only second basemen I like more than Pedroia the rest of the way are Chase Utley, Ian Kinsler, Brian Roberts, Aaron Hill and Ben Zobrist. If the Red Sox can acquire Matt Holliday or Adrian Gonzalez before the trading deadline that will push Pedroia's value even higher. If you want to acquire Pedroia you need to get it done before the All-Star break.
