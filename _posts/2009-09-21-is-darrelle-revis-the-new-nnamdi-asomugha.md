    Is Darrelle Revis the new Nnamdi Asomugha?
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">
    Andre Johnson and Randy Moss are considered 2 of the top 10 (at minimum) wide receivers and Revis has shut both of them down this season.

  <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">
    Week 1 4 catches 35 yards (with Revis covering him)
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">

  <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">
    Week 1 12 catches 141 yards

  <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">

  <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">
    Now I know some of you Patriot lovers might say, there was no Wes Welker, Moss got double teamed, the truth is it didn't matter, Revis was physical with Moss at the line "If he went to the bathroom, I followed him," Revis said. Moss was charged for an extra bag on the trip back to Foxboro after it was discovered Revis made it back on the plane with him.

    Fantasy owners won't have to worry about Revis shutting down a stud WR for a while, the Jets play Tennessee, New Orleans, Miami, Buffalo and Oakland the next 5 weeks. None of whom have a clear #1 WR (Colston is the #1 in New Orleans, but 8 guys catch balls every week)
  </div>

    On the other hand Asomugha allowed a receiving TD to Vincent Jackson and has been severly hampered by his injured wrist which limits his 5-yard bump and run strategy.
  </div>

  <div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">
    I wouldn't necessary call Revis the best cover corner in the league since this is only his second season but with a genius like Rex Ryan around him he'll be in the top 3 for years to come.
