    Urban Meyer doesn't like hearing bad things about is current players, and I guess his former players as well.  Jeremy Fowler, a reporter for the Orlando Sentinel apparently forgot that.  Here is what Urban says during the Loud beeps in the video:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "You'll be out of practice - you understand that? - if you do that again.  I told you five years ago: Don't mess with our players. Don't do it. You did it. You do it one more time and the Orlando Sentinel's not welcome here ever again. Is that clear? It's yes or no."
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Meyer was reacting to a story posted on the <a href="http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college_uf/2010/03/florida-gators-wr-deonte-thompson-sounds-happy-to-usher-in-post-tebow-era.html">Orlando Sentinel's Web site</a> following Monday's practice. Deonte Thompson was asked what the biggest difference was between Tebow and Brantley. Heres what was written:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "You never know with Tim," Thompson said. "He can bolt. You'll think he's running, but then he'll just come up and pass it to you. You just have to be ready at all times. With Brantley, everything's with rhythm, time. Like, you know what I mean, a real quarterback."
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    He says he was just quoting the guy, but the writer could have changed the words around, or at least said it a lot better. One things for sure, you rip Tim Tebow and you might get your media license revoked.
  </p>

  <p>
    But face the facts Urban Meyer.  It's true.  Tebow didn't play like a real QB, he played like some sort of freak running back that had a good arm.  He didn't play like a normal QB, but that was because of the system he was in.  Maybe he will do well in the NFL, but chances are he won't right away, he is going to be a team's "project".
