    Ben Roethlisberger was going around in Milledgeville, Georgia  with two off-duty cops from Pennsylvania.  Ben was  also with an on-duty officer who happened to  be the first to  investigate the alleged sexual assault.  These pictures were taken about an hour before the alleged victim filed a complaint of sexual assault.

      Sgt. Jerry Blash, who wrote a small incident report that did not name Roethlisberger, had a close-up picture taken with the celebrity football player inside a local bar and, later, outside the bar with a group of other officers.  But according to the police Chief he had little to do with the later investigation.

      I am pretty sure those pictures might affect the public's view of the investigation. Outlook not good for the Milledgeville Police Department. I think they might want to think about having that officer take a leave of absence. This doesn't look good for Big Ben at all, this makes it seem like he is getting special treatment from his cop friends if he doesn't get charged with anything.  But hey look at the bright side, the cop isn't taken shots with Roethlisberger.
