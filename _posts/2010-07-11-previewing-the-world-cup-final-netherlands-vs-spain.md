  <p>
    The World Cup Final: Netherlands vs Spain will take place today, July 11, 2010 at 2:30 PM ET at Soccer City Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa.
  </p>

  <p>
    Spain is the slight favorite in this game featuring two highly technical teams who love to possess the ball. David Villa from Spain and Wesley Sneijder are the players to watch, with 5 goals each so far in this tournament.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both teams have a long history of disappointing World Cup finishes, but someone will end today with a victory. I think a goal from Wesley Sneijder will be the only score of this game and the Netherlands will pull the upset, 1-0.
