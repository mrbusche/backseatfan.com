<div class="entry">
  <p>
    <br /> This is a pretty nice game winning scramble by high school quarterback Craig Billington of Genoa-Kingston (Ill.) High School. Although I think it is mostly bad tackling, it is still pretty amazing that he got through all of those tackles. Â Plus, he won the game so it makes it that much better.</div>
