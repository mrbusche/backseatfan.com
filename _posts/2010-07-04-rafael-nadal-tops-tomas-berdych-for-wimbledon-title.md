    Rafael Nadal swept Tomas Berdych in straight sets Sunday to win his second Wimbledon title and eighth Grand Slam championship.<br /> The top-ranked Spaniard beat the 12th-seeded Czech 6-3, 7-5, 6-4, needing 2 hours and 13 minutes to extend his record to 5-0 in his last five Grand Slam Finals.Â With his 8th Grand Slam title, nadal joins an exclusive list that includes Andre Agassi, Ivan Lendl, ken Rosewall, Jimmy Connors and Fred Perry.<br /> Nadal returned to Wimbledon after missing last year with tendinitis in his knees. &#8220;It was probably one of the toughest moments in my career,&#8221; Nadal said after accepting the winner's trophy Sunday from the Duke of Kent. &#8220;A win here was always my dream. I did it two years ago.
