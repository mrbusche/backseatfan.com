Announcing leading rusher Adam Robinson and starting Guard Dace Richardson are likely out for the year.
  </p>

  <p>
    Robinson, a freshmen, had started 7 games in a row for the #4 Hawkeyes and his 78.6 ypg were fourth in the Big 10. Most importantly Robinson set career highs in attempts and yards last week against Michigan State. Rushing 27 times for 109 yards.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tru freshman Brandon Wegher will get his first career start on Saturday but with some injured ribs he is questionable for the game. That leaves Iowa very thin at running back with Paki O'Meara the only other active RB on their roster. The Hawkeyes lost sophomore running back Jewel Hampton in the preseason.
  </p>

  <p>
    Starting right guard Dace Richardson will miss the rest of the regular season with a broken bone in his leg.
