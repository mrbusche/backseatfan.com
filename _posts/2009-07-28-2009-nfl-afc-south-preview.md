    Overview: The Titan had a remarkable season in 2008 with expected starter vince Young on the bench for all but one game. Rookie Chris Johnson surprised everyone with a great season and LenDale White became a touchdown machine. Bo Scaife also emerged as one of the best receiving TEs in the league. If all starters on offense can improve or at least stay consistent from last season the Titans will be in for a good season. On defense the Titans lost all world tackle Albert Haynesworth, but I don't think the loss will affect them as much as people think, Haynesworth missed time last year and the Titans weren't severely affected. Courtland Finnegan emerged as a big time player in the secondary last season and will become more of a vocal leader this season. The division battles will be rough but expect the Titans to emerge in the end.

    Overview: The Colts started off very sluggish in Peyton Mannings first few games back from new injury then won 9 in a row to finish the season at 12-4. The Colts running game struggled all season with Joseph Addai hurt and injuries all along the offensive line. The lone bright spot for the Colts was the passing game which was still firing on all cylinders. Bob Sanders needs to find a way to stay on the field since he is a game changer when he is on the field. The same goes for the oft-injured Dwight Freeney. The loss of Tony dungy and Marvin Harrison will be tough to overcome, but I expect the experience players such as Anthony Gonzalez got last year will lead the Colts to another playoff appearance.

    Overview: The Texans were victims of bad luck last season with Hurrican Ike caused their bye week to be pushed up to week 2. The Texans started off 0-4 but won 5 of their last 6 to finish at 8-8. If the Texans expect to have success this season QB Matt Schaub needs to stay healthy and the same goes for RB Steve Slaton and WR Andre Johnson who is a reception machine. On defense the linebackers will be solid with emerging star DeMeco Ryans and rookie Brian Cushing but there are question marks on the defensive line. The Texans should improve on last season 8 wins but I don't think they'll be able to do enough to lock up a playoff spot

    Overview: The Jaguars were a disappoinment in 2008 they were picked by many to reach the Super Bowl and they fell far short of that. I don't think this season will be much different. They add Torry Holt to the WR corps but can you name one other WR on their roster? Troy Williamson you say? Okay, how about receivers who can catch? None. I'm not sure why they passed on a WR in the first couple rounds in the draft but it will hurt them this season, especially with Maurice Jones-Drew the only proven running back on the roster. A young secondary and linebacking core will be asked to do a lot this season and I don't think they will live up to expectations. I found 6 wins for the Jaguars this season but I wouldn't put money on that
