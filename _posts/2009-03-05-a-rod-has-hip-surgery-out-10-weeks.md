  <p>
    ESPN Deportes Enrique Rojas, is reporting Alex Rodriquez will undergo hip surgery and will likely be out 10 weeks. In an off season that has included a leaked steroid test and an admission to using performance enhancing drugs, it was thought things couldn't get much worse for Rodriguez. This news comes two days after A-Rod visited a specialist about a cyst on his hip.

    A source close to the situation told ESPNdeportes.com that the surgery is scheduled for Monday, March 9th, in Colorado. The surgery also means Rodriquez will be unavailable for the World Baseball Classic that begins next week.

  <p>
    Since A-Rods most productive months tend to be in April and May what does this mean for his statistics this season? Will he have the worst year of his career? What does this mean for the Yankees? Does this give Boston and Tampa Bay the edge in the division this year?
